Habitat : The city  of Ahmedabad lies  in the western  Indian  state  of Gujarat  and is  part  of the well  developed  hinterland  region  of the state .
The city  itself stretches  along the banks  of the dry  riverbed  of the Sabarmati River .
The Sabarmati neatly  bifurcates  the city  into two   the old  quarter  on the eastern  side  with the business  and industrial  centre  and the new  city  with more  contemporary  landscape  of malls  and arcades , highrise  buildings  and cinema_houses .
The city  is  full  of architectural  delights .
The older  parts  of the city  are  famous  for their admixture  of  Indo Saracenic  architecture .
The areas  with a stronger  Hindu  influence  have  a labyrinth  of  bylanes  called  'pols' with exquisite  carved  wooden  mansions  and havelis.
The story  so far: After its creation  in 1411 , the city  went_through  successive  periods  of glory  and decline .
It flourished  during the 16 th  and the 17 th  centuries  when it became  one of the finest  cities  in India  and then  waned  during the 18 th  century , when the Marathas  challenged  the might  of the  Moghul  Empire .
It rose  to prominence  once_again  with the establishment  of the textile  industry  and as Gandhi ’s base  for the nationalist  movement  for Indian  Independence .
Ahmedabad became  the base  camp  for the Indian  freedom  struggle  with Gandhi  Sabarmati Ashram  on the outskirts  of the city .
From here  he guided  India  to freedom  after the freedom  movement  this city  of textiles , often  called  the Manchester  of the East , became  a national  pilgrimage , a symbol  of nonviolence  and peace .
Though the capital  of Gujarat  was shifted  from Ahmedabad to Gandhinagar, it is  still  the second  largest  industrial  city  in western  India .
Over a period_of_time  Ahmedabad has consolidated  its position  as a vibrant  business  and commercial  city  but is  also  famed  as an academic  centre  with a number  of premier  institutions  of higher  studies  located  here .
 The Indian_rupee  is  available  in denominations  of Rs 1 , Rs 2 , Rs 5 , Rs 10 , Rs 20 , Rs 50 , Rs 100  and Rs 500 . 
 The most  meager  that your budget  should get  is  US  $ 20  per day  of your stay : on this amount , you’ll struggle  with dormitory  accommodation , look_for  cheap  grub  and constantly  try  to figure_out  bus  routes  and timings  but you’ll just_about  survive .
$ 40  a day  will see  you sleep  in decent  clean  beds  and wake_up  to an attached  bathroom  for morning  ablutions .
It'll fetch  you three  decent  meals , a spot  of shopping  and some   auto rickshaw  rides .
The bare  minimum  is  just  under $ 18  a day  while a top end holiday  could blow through the roof.
