In Pench Jungle camp  there’s a spacious  dining_area  and a well  stocked  bar .
Once  the palace  of Maharaja  Jivajirao Scindia,this heritage  hotel  Usha Kiran Palace  (named  after the maharaja ’s daughter ) is  now  in the hands  of the Taj Group , who have added  that extra  touch  of luxury  and sophistication  to the lavishly  decorated  suites  and deluxe  rooms .
The four_poster  beds  and mosaic   floors , antique  furniture , mirrors  and attached  marble  baths  are  all part  of the royal  experience .
Set  in extensive  manicured  lawns  Usha Kiran Palace, a regal  120  – year  – old  building , with ornate  stone  carved  interiors , marble  staircase , sandstone  filigree  – work  screens  and arched  doorways , is built  gracefully  around a vast  central  courtyard , where you can spend  many_a  meditative  afternoon .

Run  by the descendants  of the Begum  of Bhopal, few  other  hotels  can match  its standard  of hospitality .
For elegance  and luxury , the rooms  and Darbar Hall  of Jehan Numa palace  get  full  marks  while the vast  courtyards  add  to the aristocratic  ambience . 
Bhopali cuisine  is  at its best  at Shahnama and the new  Italian  restaurant  never  disappoints .
Adding  to all  the other  facilities  is  the fantastic  view  of Upper  Lake , just  two  minutes  away .
Once  the guesthouse  of the Maharaja  of Dhar and the venue  for banquets  and fancy_dress  balls  of the British  officials , the Jhira Bagh palace  is  an elegant  heritage  hotel  today .

Chaat aficionados  will find  heaven  in the streets  of Indore and Gwalior, while every  kebab  fan  will swear  by Bhopal’s cuisine .
If it’s spicy , savoury  snacks  that tickle  your palate , Sarafa Bazaar  in Indore is  the place  to go .
The Sarafa bazaar , a  stone’s throw  from the town  centre  of Rajawada, is lined  with small  silver  jewellery  shops  during the day , but transforms  into a popular  chaat bazaar  after 10  p.m.  each  night .
In every  corner  are  sizzling  tawas with sabut dana khichadi (a lightly  spiced  sago  concoction ), dal kachoris, samosas , mathris, bhutta kis (grated  corn  sauteed  in ghee  and garnished  with coconut  and coriander_leaves ) garadu (deep_fried  potatoes ) and countless  other  delights .
For a more  substantial  treat , try  Bafla, a distinctive  Malwa  specialty .
Bafla is  a large  round  ball  of wheat_flour  roasted  on cow_dung  cakes ; it is usually  dipped  in dal and soaked  a lot  of ghee .
Also  try  shikanji, the special  thick  creamy  Malwa milk  drink  flavored  with almonds .
Don’t miss  local  desserts  such as Moong halwa, thick  rabri, mawa bati or churma.
In the old  city  of Bhopal, the aroma  of kebabs  barbecued  every  evening  wafts  through the narrow  bustling  galis.
Chatori gali, famous  for biryani  and kebabs  near Ibrahimpura, is  the best   bet  but there’s a lone  stall  in Budhwara with the most   meltinthemouth  seekh kebabs .
The proprietors  of the stall  in Budhwara has been whipping_up  these fantastic  beef  kebabs  for over three  decades  and while the taste  just  gets  better , the prices  haven’t changed  a bit  – just  Rs. 5  for a succulent  plateful .
On the street  winding  past the Moti Masjid  are  keema samosas  and seekh kebabs  in a makeshift  barbecue .
Ask  any  vendor  for directions  where you can get  delicious  baigan ki boorani, achaar gosht and rogan josh, all flavoured  with nutmeg , mace , garlic , ginger , coriander_leaves  and kewra.
Deep_fried  fish  (usually  sanwal) coated  with yoghurt  mixed  with coriander , garlic  and green  chillies  is  another   must try .
For a thick , richly  flavoured  and decidedly  non  vegetarian  twist  on the humble  khichdi, order  a plateful  of haleem, a split_pea , wheat  and meat  concoction .
Near the old  city  of Bhopal, Filfora is  a tiny  restaurant  in Kohefiza.
Run  by a muslim  family  that has lived  in Bhopal for generations , Kohefiza is  simple , hygienic  place  where you can have  your fill  of authentic  Bhopali Nawabi cuisine .

While you can sit  on the small  landscaped  lawns  and eat , the place  can get  rather  crowded  especially  on weekends .
The take–away  option  often  works  better  – the food  is quickly  and efficiently  packed  for you.
From the dawn  to midnight , the stalls  of Naya Bazaar  are packed  with people  clamouring  for the favourite  Gwalior breakfast  (and snack ) of piping  hot  moong dal kachori, flavoured  with amchur and fennel_seeds  and fried  in plenty  of hot  ghee .
Also  scrumptious  breakfast  favourite  are  the Jalebis, made  of maida and sugar_syrup , the orange  swirls  are  deep_fried  in vast  amounts  of ghee .
A visit  to Gwalior is  not  complete  until you sample  gajak, a sesame  – coated  sweets , mixed  with ghee  and flavoured  with cardamom .
A flaky  treat , gajak is made  in the small  nearby  district  of Morena, but sold  in Gwalior where people  jostle  for a place  at the counters  of the shops  that sell  boxes  of it.
The best  quality , without a doubt , is  available  at Morena Gajak Bhandar in the Naya Sadak Bazaar .
On offer  are  at_least  six  varieties  of this popular  sweet , said  to warm  you up in the winter  cold  with special  ingredients  added  such as dried_fruit , jaggery  or revadi, all for about  Rs. 100  a kilo .
The flesh  of the Kadaknath chicken  is  jet_black  which doesn’t look  very  appetizing , but cooked  in a simple  curry , it is  quite  delicious .
Kadaknath chicken  is found  only  in the district  of Jhabua, which has  a large  tribal  population  of Bhils and is often  served  on festive  occasions .
The best  way  to get  a palm_leaf full  of the rather  evil_looking  concoction  is  to ask  the local  food  stall  owners  if they have  it on their menu .
For a royal  culinary  experience , book  a table  at the elegant  Silver Saloon restaurant  in the Maharaja  of Gwalior’s palace , now  turned  into the plush  Usha Kiran Palace Hotel .
Enter  through the stone  archways  to your table  set  in magenta  and peach  and lit  gently  with discreet  lamps .
A rich  choice  of Indian  and continental  fare  is  on offer  but you go_for  the Maratha dishes  difficult  to get  elsewhere , expect in Gwalior homes .
Straight  out of the royal  Scindia kitchen , following  100  year  old  recipes , are  the masala chaas, lamb  barbat cooked  in a special  mixture  of spices , dal, chicken , paneer ka achaar and Nepalese  mushrooms  to name  a few . 
Named  after its row  of 56  shops , Chhappan Bazaar  is  famous  for its array  of small   eateries .

For a carnival  atmosphere  and the joy  of eating , or just  for Indore’s famous  sweets  and lassi, an evening  of chaat – stall  hopping , Chhappan bazaar  is  your best   bet .
For Bhopali Nawabi cuisine  at its best , try  the Shahnama in Jehan Numa palace , a world  heritage  palace  of Bhopal royalty , for the yoghurt  – based  kormas, chicken  nawabi and aromatic  Bhopali rizala, biryani  and the khoya rich  shahi tukra.
