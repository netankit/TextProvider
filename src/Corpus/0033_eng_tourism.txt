The major  drawback  of this machine was  the volume  of liquid  and proportional  antifreeze  additives  necessary ; it was  closed  to the public  every  year  from November  to March  
 :2 : After 93  years  of wear_and_tear  it was  replaced  in 1982  with two  electrically  powered  sets  of two  counterbalanced  cabins , running all  year  round  
 :3 : This also  enabled  to restructure  the crisscross  beams  between the second  and third  floor  allowing  for two  separate  emergency  staircases  to replace the dangerous  winding  units that were there from the structure ’s origin 
 :4 : The Tower 's artificial  illuminations  have been constantly  revised  and improved  throughout the years  taking  advantage  of the latest  innovations  in lighting  
 :5 : From gas  to electricity  incandescent  lamps  to neon  and not  forgetting  the sodium  lamp  
 :6 : At the dawn  of the 20 th  century  the Eiffel_Tower  adopted  quite  quickly  the new  electric  technology  
 :7 : Universal  Exposition  of 1889

 :10 : In 1937 , André Granet added  colored  lighting  to the latticework  handrails  for the International  Exposition  of Arts  and Techniques  
 :11 : The lighting  system  in the place  since 1985  relies  on 352  sodium  yellow orange  tint  lamps  placed  on the inside  of the Tower  structure  for an extremely  effective  way  of flaunting  the Tower's intricate  beauty  
 :12 : The Eiffel_Tower  was recently  adorned  with 2  light_beams  capable  of being seen  80  kilometers  away  and activated  each  evening  when the Tower lights_up 
 :13 : The beacon  is  composed of four  marinetype motorized  projectors  
 :14 : They are  operated  by automatically  piloted  computer_programs  
 :15 : Since their rotation  sweep  is 90 °, they are  synchronized  to form  a double  beam  in a cross  that pivots  around 360 °. 
 :16 : The xenon  6000  watt  lamps  were chosen  for their longevity  around 1200  hours  
 :17 : The lamps  are cooled  to prevent  overheating  and a heating  system  is activated  when the temperatures  drop  below zero  Centigrade  whilst the lights  are off_ 
 :18 : This beacon  represents  the image  of Gustave_Eiffel  Tower itself as a universal  and symbolic  landmark  
 :19 : The Tower’s golden  lighting  adds  20 ,000  flashing  lights  for a glittering  performance  of light  on the hour  
 :20 : The beautiful  sparkling  lights  of New_Year's  Eve  2000  will be visible  all year  long  
 :21 : Taking  the role  of a time_piece  the Tower  will announce  the hour  with 5  minutes  of glittering  lights  in_tandem  with the permanent  gold toned lights  at nightfall  every  hour  on the hour  
 :22 : The last  sparkle  at 1  am will conclude the daily  performance  with a special  finale   ten  minutes  of sparkling  lights  with the gold  lighting  system  shut_down  
 :23 : The 20 ,000  flashes  will also  sound  the gong  at noon  with a ten  minute  display  of diamond  sparkles  
 :24 : The Eiffel_Tower  will once_again  sparkle  each  hour  on the hour  for ten  minutes  from dusk  until 2  am (1  am in winter ) 
 :25 : This new  lighting  fixture  is coupled  with the gold toned lighting  system  in place  since 1986  for maximum  effect  
 :26 : But for the inauguration  celebration  the gold  lighting  will shut_down  for ten  minutes  allowing  the glowing  diamond sparkles  to perform  a new  magical  presentation  sure  to enthrall  the enthusiastic  crowds  below 
 :27 : Relying  on spotlights  on the outer  Tower  the most  celebrated  monument  in Paris  beamed  scarlet  red  colors  for the occasion  of the Chinese  New_Year  on Saturday  January  24 , 2004 . 
 :28 : Following  the Chinese  New_Year  parade  on the ChampsElyséees  the Chinese  and French  Culture ministers  as well as the mayors  of Peking  and Paris  were present  at the "lights on " ceremony  at the Tower  
 :29 : The original  operating  concession  had been awarded  to the company  Société de la Tour Eiffel 
 :30 : When it expired  in 1980 , the City  of Paris  took more  direct  control  of the Tower  through the means  of a mixed  capital  company  called  SNTE (Société Nouvelle d' Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel). 
 :31 : One  of its first  actions  was  to launch  an ambitious  program  of restoration  and renovation  of the Tower 
 :32 : The structure  was given  a thorough  examination  strengthened  in parts  and also  lightened  by the removal  of 1 ,340  tons  of material  that had been added  over  the years  
 :33 : Safety  standards  were  redefined  and adapted  to modern  requirements  particularly  where they concerned  fire  safety  
 :34 : The third  level  elevator  was  replaced  as was  the old  spiral  staircase  which gave_way  to a new  rectilinear  staircase  
 :35 : This course  of rejuvenating treatment  a process  which is  permanently  under_way , helps  give the Tower  a very  long  life_expectancy  
 :36 : A new  elevator  was  installed  between the second  and third  levels  of the Tower  in 1983 . 
 :37 : It consists  of four  cabins; making the connection  between the two  levels  in one  go  
 :38 : A new  staircase  was  also  installed  at_the_same_time

 :45 : Covering  an area  of about 81  hectares  the complex  consists  of five  towers  which are  presently  shown  on the Cambodian  national_flag  
 :46 : These towers  are  believed  to represent  the five  peaks  of Mount  Meru, the Home  of Gods  and Center  of the Hindu  Universe  
 :47 : Angkor Wat features  the longest  continuous  basrelief  in the world  which runs_along  the outer  gallery  walls  narrating  stories  from Hindu  Mythology

 :53 : He garrisoned  armies  at the Wall to stand_guard  over the workers  as well as to defend  the northern  boundaries  
 :54 : The tradition  lasted  for centuries . Each  dynasty  added  to the height , breadth , length  and elaborated  the design  mostly  through forced  labor  
 :55 : It was  during the Ming_dynasty  (1368 1644 ) that the Wall took_on  its present  form  
 :56 : The brick  and granite  work  was enlarged  and sophisticated  designs  were added  
 :57 : The watch_towers  were  redesigned  and modern  cannon  were mounted  in strategic  areas

 :59 : The Ming  Emperors , having overthrown  the Hun  dominance  and expelled  their Mongol  rulers  of the North , devoted  large  portions  of available  material  and manpower  to making_sure  that they didn't return  
 :60 : Throughout the centuries  armies  were garrisoned  along the length  of the Wall to provide  early  warning  of invasion  and a first  line_of_defense  
 :61 : Great  piles  of straw  and dung  used  to build  signal_fires  have been found  during excavations  
 :62 : There must have been small  garrison  towns  spotted  along the length . There weren't many  farms  or trade  towns  to provide  ease  relaxation  and food  
 :63 : The supply  trails  were over mountains  along narrow  paths  
 :64 : To bring  supplies  to the top , ropes  were slung  over posts  set  in the Chinese  side  of the wall and baskets  were hauled  up hand over hand 
 :65 : Supplies  must have always  been short  and chancy , particularly  in the winter  
 :66 : The Wall served  well . Only when a dynasty  had weakened  from within  were invaders  from the north  able  to advance  and conquer  
 :67 : Both  the Mongols  (Yuan_Dynasty  1271 1368 ) and the Manchurians (Qing_Dynasty  1644 1911 ) were able  to take  power  not  because of weakness  in the Wall but because of weakness  in the government  and the poverty  of the people
