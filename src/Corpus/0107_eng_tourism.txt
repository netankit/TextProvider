Oregon  nickname , the Beaver  State , harks_back  to the early  years  of the 19 th  century . 
Fur_hats  were  fashionable  at that time , in the northeastern  cities , and Oregon  streams  were  an important  source  of beaver .
With competition  fierce  among the fur  companies  for control  of the western  lands , adventurous  trappers , called  mountain_men , became  the first  white_people  to know  the region  well .
Later , when the rage  for beaver  hats  had passed  and Oregon  beaver  supply  was all_but  exhausted , the mountain_men  showed  the early  pioneers  a route  they had picked_out  in their trapping  years .
Known_as  the Oregon Trail , it took  thousands  during the 1840 s to the fertile  Willamette  valley , where wheat , fruits ,and vegetables  thrived .
Settlers  were also  drawn  to other  parts  of the state , where a profitable  timber  industry  later  developed  around Oregon  bountiful  supply  of douglas_fir  trees .
Oregon  became  the 33 rd  State  to unite  under America  on February  14 , 1859 .
