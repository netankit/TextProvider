Surat Thani is  a city  with a long  history ; archeologists  believe  that it was  once  a community  of prehistoric  tribes  of indigenous  people  including  the Saemang and the original  Malays  who built  their communities  on the Tapee River_Basin  and Ao Ban Don.
Later_on , the Indians  migrated  into the area  and gradually  spread_out  their culture , as evidenced  in the discovery  of the ruins  of ancient  communities  in Tha Chana and Chaiya  subdistricts .
In the 13 th  century , the city  became  a part  of and, as some  historians  might claim , a center  of the glorious  Srivijaya Empire , the kingdom  that dominated  the whole  Malay_Peninsula  and much of Java .
The empire  grandeur  can still  be  admired  in many  areas  of Chaiya district .
When the empire  hit  the bottom , Surat Thani was divided  into 3  main  cities  namely  Chaiya, Tha Thong and Khiri Rat.
King  Rama IV decided  to move  Tha Thong City  to Ban Don and required  that it report  directly  to Bangkok  administration .
The name  Ban Don was , at the time , changed  to Kanchanadit.
It was  with the establishment  of the Monthon, a former  administrative  unit , that all  three  cities  were merged  into one  under the name  Chaiya.
In 1915 , King  Rama VI changed  the name  Chaiya to Surat Thani.
The seal  of Surat Thani says  a lot  about its history .
Featuring  the pagoda  of Phra Boromathat Chaiya, the seal  is  proof  of the influence  of Mahayana  Buddhist  on Surat Thani.
Phra Boromathat Chaiya is  the most  revered  and important  historical  place  in the province .
It is believed  that the pagoda  contains  Buddha  relics .
Today , Surat Thani is  an important  commercial  and shipping  hub  for rubber  and coconut  trading .
Located  approximately  862  kilometers  south  of Bangkok  is  Phuket, Thailand  largest  island .

Andaman_Sea  and the Indian_Ocean , the province  covers  an area  of approximately  543   square kilometers  (excluding  small  islets ).
It is estimated  that Phuket Province  covers  an area  of approximately  590   square kilometers  if it’s 39  other  small  islands  are included .
The islands  total  length , from north  to south , is estimated  at 48 .7  kilometers  and approximately  21 .3  kilometers  wide .

For seafood  lovers , there is  a lot  more to sample  than just  Phuket's famous  lobster .
Most  geologists  believe  that the area  known_as  Phuket today  was  once  a cape  that extended  into the Andaman_Sea .
Geographical  formations  gradually  changed  the cape  location , finally  detaching  it from the mainland .
A famous  Greek  philosopher , Claudius_Ptolemaeus , was  the first  person  who mentioned  the cape  in his book  written  in the year  157 .
The cape  was locally  referred  to as Jung Ceylon, which was  located  between latitudes  6  N  and 8  N  (the present  site  of Phuket Island ).
Natives  called  the place  Cha Lang, which evolved  to Tha Lang, the name  of the main  town  to the north  of the island .
As a perfect  stopover  sheltering  traders  from monsoons , Jung Ceylon welcomed  merchants  from India , Persia , Arabia , Burma , China  and also  Siam .
During the 16 th  century , the island  was  also  a popular  trading  port  for tin  with Portuguese , Dutch , English  and French  traders  flocking  to the island .
Chinese  businessmen  and miners  later  migrated  to Phuket and soon  enjoyed  thriving  business  wealth . 
Apart from serving  as a meeting  point  for traders  from Europe , Central  Asia  and China , Phuket also  attracted  ambitious  immigrants , especially  those from Portugal  and China , to work  in the tin  mines .
With Phuket's colorful  history , visitors  admire  the  SinoPortuguese  style  architecture  in the city , especially  those buildings  located  along the Thalang and Yaowarat Roads .
Thalang town  was surrounded  by Burmese  troops  who invaded  the coastal  area  in 1785 .
Thalang town  was  under the leadership  of Chan, the widow  of the governor , and her sister , Muk, who united  local  residents  and successfully  fought  and drove  the invaders  out of Phuket.
Thalang took  over 30  days  for the defending  troops  of Phuket, under the command  of Chan and Muk, to claim  their victory .
As a result  of such  heroic  deeds , noble  titles  were granted  to Chan and Muk as Thao Thep Krasattri and Thao Si Sunthon respectively .
To honor  Chan and Muk, a monument  was established  at Tha Ruea Intersection , 12  kilometers  to the north  of Phuket City  in 1966 .
Chan and Muk are still  highly  respected  by Phuket residents  even  today .
However , 24  years  later , the Burmese  succeeded  in seizing  Thalang causing  many  local  residents  to flee  to Phangnga and Krabi.
In 1825 , some of them returned  to reestablish  a town  and established  a rice  farming  community .
On_the_other_hand , the area  to the south  of the island  (Phuket City  today ) was developed  and became  a tin  trading  center .
When Phuket was elevated  to a town  in 1850 , it attracted  more  immigrants  from Thalang and nearby  communities .
In 1894 , Phuket was promoted  to be  a Monthon administrative  unit  under the supervision  of the central  administrative  body  (located  in Bangkok ).
In 1902 , Phraya Ratsada Korsimbi, a  SinoThai  businessman  who contributed  to developing  the modern  city  of Phuket was appointed  Governor  of Phuket.
Phraya Ratsada Korsimbi also  helped  to improve  the welfare  of local  residents  and set_up  the 
market  system  in the countryside .
In 1916 , Phuket became  a province .
The tin  mining  industry  has gradually  failed  to generate  economic  growth  in Phuket, especially  after 1985  when the price  of tin  fell  by half . 
However , with its natural_resources , Phuket later  emerged  as a tourist  destination  with great  potential .
Phuket, polished  pearl  of the Andaman is  truly  a destination  that provides  visitors  with memorable  experiences .
The island  long  history  has shaped  the distinctive  Phuket of the present  with its diverse  ethnic  groups , culture , architectural  influence  and fine  cuisine .
With approximately  35  percent  of the population  being comprised  of  ThaiMuslims , it is  possible  to see  an equal  number  of Wats (Thai  temples ) located  next to mosques .
Found  in the 13 th  century , Sukhothai (literally  means  Dawn  of Happiness ) was  the first  truly  independent  Thai  Kingdom , which enjoyed  a golden_age  under King  Ramkhamhaeng, credited  with creating  the Thai  alphabet .
The superb  temples  and monuments  of this great  city  have been lovingly  restored  in Sukhothai Historical  Park , a UNESCO  World  Heritage  Site  and a  mustsee  for all  travellers .
Sukhothai is  located  on the lower  edge  of the northern  region , 427  kilometres  north  of Bangkok  or some  298  kilometres  south  of Chiang Mai.
The province  covers  some  6 ,596   square kilometres  and is divided  into 9  Amphoes: Muang Sukhothai, Ban Dan Lan Hoi, Khiri Mat, Kong Krailat, Sawankhalok, Si Nakhon, Si Samrong, Si Satchanalai and Thung Saliam.
Sukhothai was  the first  kingdom  of the Thais  in this peninsula .
Two  princes   Pho Khun Pha Muang and Pho Khun Bang Klang Hao combined  their forces  and fought  the Khmers  who commanded  an extensive  empire  throughout this part  of the world .
Pho Khun Pha Muang and Pho Khun Bang Klang Hao drove  the Khmers  out of Sukhothai, a major  frontier  post  of the  Khmer  Empire  and established  it as their capital  in 1238 .
Pho Khun Bang Klang Hao, urged  by the people  to be  king , was enthroned  with the royal  title  of Pho Khun Si Indrathit.
King  Si Indrathit had  two  sons   Pho Khun Ban Mueang and Pho Khun Ramkhamhaeng and after his death , Pho Khun Ban Mueang succeeded  him.
Si Indrathit's brother , Pho Khun Ramkhamhaeng, ascended  the throne  in 1278  and reigned  for forty  years .
Pho Khun Ramkhamhaeng, the younger  brother  of king  Si Indrathit was  Thailand  first  great  king .
One of Thailand  finest  warriors , King  Ramkhamhaeng made  Sukhothai a powerful  and extensive  kingdom  which included  many  parts  of what are  today  neighbouring  countries .
King  Ramkhamhaeng opened  direct  political  relations  with China  and made  two  trips  to China   the first  in 1282  to visit  Emperor  Kublai_Khan  and the second  in 1300  after Kublai_Khan  's death .
From the second  visit , he brought_back  Chinese  artisans  who taught  the Thais  the art  of pottery .
Today , the old  Sangkhalok Potteries  are eagerly  sought  by collectors .
A major  achievement  of King  Ramkhamhaeng was  the revision  of various  forms  of Khmer  alphabets  into a system  suitable  for the writing  of Thai  words .
The alphabet  that he invented  in 1283  was essentially  the same  as that in_use  today .
During the reign  of king  Ramkhamhaeng, there was  prosperity  and happiness .
A stone  inscription  reads  in part : This Muang Sukhothai is  good . 
In the water  there are  fish ; in the field  there is  rice .
