Mumtaz and Shah Jehan were  married  in 1612  and, over  the next  18  years  had 14  children  together . 
The Empress  used  to accompany  her husband  in his military  campaigns , and it was  in 1630 , in Burhanpur, that she gave_birth  to her last  child  for she died  in childbirth  
So great  was the Emperor ’s love  for his wife  that he ordered  the building  of the most  beautiful  mausoleum  on Earth  for her. 
Although it is not  known  for_sure  who planned  the Taj, the name  of an Indian  architect  of Persian  descent , Ustad Ahmad Lahori, has been cited  in many  sources  
As soon as construction  began  in 1630 , masons  craftsmen , sculptors  and calligraphers  were summoned  from Persia  the Ottoman_Empire  and Europe  to work  on the masterpiece  
The site  was chosen  near  the Capital  Agra  on the southwest  bank  of the River  Yamuna. 
The architectural  complex  is comprised  of five  main  elements : the Darwaza or main  gateway  the Bageecha or garden  the Masjid  or mosque  the Naqqar Khana or rest_house  and the Rauza or the Taj_Mahal  mausoleum . 
The actual  Tomb  is  situated  inside  the Taj. 
The unique  mughal style  combines  elements  of Persian , Central  Asian  and Islamic  architecture  
Most  impressive  are the black  and white  chessboard  marble  floor  the four  tall  minarets  (40_m  high ) at the corners  of the structure  and the majestic  dome  in the middle  
On closer  look  the lettering  of the Quran  verses  around the archways  appears  to be  uniform , regardless  of their height  
The lettering , spacing  and density  has been customized  to give  this impression  to the beholder  
Other  illusionary  effects  have been accounted  for in the geometry  of the tomb  and the tall  minarets  
The impressive  pietra dura artwork  includes  geometric  elements , plants  and flowers    most  common  in Islamic  architecture  
The level  of sophistication  in artwork  becomes  obvious  when one realizes  that a 3  cm  decorative  element  contains  more_than  50  inlaid  gemstones  
The High_Dam  located just  south  of the city  of_Aswan  in Egypt  was constructed  not_only  to regulate  the yearly  flood  of the Nile  but also  to create  a water  reservoir  capable  of storing  water  to prevent  famine  during severe  droughts . 
Construction  of the Dam  began  in 1960  as a national  project  undertaken  by Egyptian  president  Nasser  who nationalized  the Suez_Canal  to provide  funds  for the project  
With the American and the British refusing  to secure  a loan  for the construction  it was the Soviets  that designed  the earth  structure  and provided  the equipment  required  to build  the power_station  
During the course  of construction  provisions  were made  to repatriate  the Nubian  inhabitants  and, in a multinational  effort  to relocate  the Great  Temple  of Abu Simbel. 
In 1970 , the Aswan_High_Dam  was  inaugurated  by president  Sadat . 
Today  the reservoir  known_as  Lake_Nasser  spans  approximately 500  kilometers  across the EgyptioSudanese  border  
In spite of the ecological  problems  caused  by the dam  it has been a blessing  to the Egyptian  community  
It left  the country  unaffected  by the drought  that hit Africa  during the late  1980 's, and, in the 1990 's, spared  Egypt  several  unexpectedly  high  floods  
A regulated  agricultural  system  is now  in place, and, in 1996 , for the first  time , the water  in Nasser_Lake  rose above the spill  level  
Plans  are underway  to populate  the area  along the spillway  of Toshka and to create  new  communities  along the recently  constructed  Zayed Canal  in the heart  of the Sahara_Desert  
The Itaipú hydroelectric  power_plant_is  the largest  development  of its kind  in operation  in the world  
Built  from 1975  to 1991 , in a binational development on the Paraná River  Itaipú represents  the efforts  and accomplishments  of two  neighboring  countries  Brazil  and Paraguay  
The power_plant  18  generating units  add_up  to a total  production  capacity  of 12 ,600  MW (megawatts ) and a reliable  output  of 75  million  MWh a year  
Itaipú's energy  production  has broken  several  records  over  the recent  years  after the last  generating unit  was commissioned  in 1991 . 
 The generation  of 77 .212 .396  MWh a year  in 1995  will again  be surpassed  in 1996 , and the new  record  will be around  the 80  million  MWh a year  mark 
The magnitude  of the project  can also  be demonstrated  by the fact  that in 1995  Itaipú alone  responded  for 25 % of the energy  supply  in Brazil  and 78 % in Paraguay  
The_power_plant_ is  also  a major  tourism  attraction  in the Foz do Iguaçú area  having received  around 9  million  visitors  from 162  countries  
The Brazilian  city  of Foz do Iguaçu, also  home of the famous  Iguaçú Falls  is  located  at the Western  tip of Paraná State  right  by the border  with Paraguay  and Argentina  
The Itaipú hydroelectric  power_plant  located  14  kilometers  North  of the International  Bridge  linking the cities  of Foz do Iguaçú, Brazil  and Ciudad del Este, Paraguay  consists  of a series  of various  types  of dams  a total  distance  of 7 ,744  meters  with a crest  elevation  of 225  meters  
The Powerhouse  is located  at the top  of the main  Dam  most  of it on the river_bed  and the rest  on the Diversion  Channel  
The nominal  power  of the plant  is 12 ,600  MW, divided  between 18  generating units  of 700  MW each  15  of which are located in the main  Powerhouse  and the remaining  three  on the Diversion  Channel  
The Spillway  is located  on the right  bank  and it has 14  segmented  sluicegates  with a total  discharge  rate of 62 ,200  cubic_meters  per second  (twice  that of the highest  flood  level  on record ) 
The Concrete  Main  Dam  is  of the hollow  gravity  type  and is connected  to the Spillway  by a concrete  buttress type  Wing Dam which continues  thereon  as a small  Cardhfill dike  
On the left  bank  a Rockfill Dam  is  linked  to the Main  Dam  and at the other  end  to an Earthfill Dam  
In order to build  the main  dam  wall  and the Powerhouse  the river  was diverted  through a Diversion  Channel  on the left  bank  
The volumes  of construction  in Itaipú are also  impressive  
The volume  of iron  and steel  utilized  in the Dam  structure  would be enough  to build  380  Eiffel_Towers  and the volume  of concrete  used  in Itaipú represents  15  times  the volume  utilized  to build  the Channel_Tunnel  between France  and England  
Itaipú is one  of the Seven  Wonders  of the_Modern_World  according  to a worldwide  survey  conducted by the American  Society  of civil_Engineer s (ASCE) and published  in Dec  1995  as a cover article  of the NorthAmerican  "Popular  Mechanics " 
The article  says  that " To build  [the Itaipú Dam ] workers  reenacted  a labor  of Hercules , they shifted  the course  of the seventh  biggest  river  in the world  (Paraná River  at the Brazil /Paraguay  border ) and removed  more_than  50  million  tons  of earth  and rock  
“According  to the magazine  "the true  marvel  of Itaipú, though is its powerhouse  ... a single  building  that puts out 12 ,600  megawatts   enough  to power  most  of California " 
The idea  of a canal  linking the Mediterranean  to the Red_Sea  dates_back  to ancient  times  
Unlike the modern  Canal  earlier  ones linked the_Red_Sea_ to the Nile ; therefore  forcing  the ships  to sail along the River  on their journey  from Europe  to India  
It has been suggested  that the first  Canal  was dug  during the reign  of Tuthmosis III, although more  solid  evidence  credits  the Pharaoh  Necho (Sixth  Century  BC ) for the attempt  
During the Persian  invasion  of Egypt , King  Darius_I  ordered  the Canal completed  
The Red_Sea  Canal  consisted  of two  parts , the first  linking the Gulf_of_Suez  to the Great Bitter Lake and the second  connecting the Lake to one  of the Nile  branches  in the Delta  
The canal  remained  in good  condition  during the Ptolemaic  era  but fell  into disrepair  afterwards  
 It was redug during the rule  of the Roman  Emperor  Trajan , and later  the Arab ruler  Amr IbnAlAas. 
 Over  the years  it fell  again  into disrepair  and was completely  abandoned  upon the discovery  of the trade  route  around Africa  
It was Napoleon  engineers  who around 1800  AD , revived  the idea  of a shorter  trade_route  to India  via a Suez_Canal  
However  the calculation  carried_out  by the French  engineers  showed  a difference  in level  of 10  meters  between both  seas  
If constructed  under such  circumstances  a large  land_area  would be flooded  
Later  the calculations  showed  to be wrong  and the final  attempt  to dig  the Canal was undertaken  by former  French  Consul  in Cairo  and famous  Canal  digger  Ferdinand_de_Lesseps . 
He was granted  a "firman" or decree  by the khedive . Khedive  Said of Egypt  to run  the Canal for 99  years  after completion  
In 1859 , Egyptian  workers  started  working  on the construction  of the Canal in conditions  described  by historians  as slave  labor  and the project  was completed  around 1867 . 
On November  17 , 1869 , the Canal  was officially  inaugurated  by Khedive  Ismail in an extravagant  and lavish  ceremony  
French  British  Russian  and other  Royalty  were invited  for the inauguration  which coincided  with the replanning of Cairo  
A highway  was constructed  linking Cairo  to the new  city of Ismailia, an Opera_House  was built  and Verdi  was commissioned  to compose  his famous  opera  "Aida" for the opening  ceremony  
Ironically  Verdi  did not complete  the work  in time  and "Aida" premiered  at the Cairo  Opera  a year  later  
The Suez_Canal  emerged  on the political  scene  in 1956 , during the Suez  crisis  
It was in July  of that year  the Egyptian  president  Nasser , at age  38 , announced  the nationalization  of the Canal  at Mansheya Square  in Alexandria  in front of a cheering  crowd  
His decision  was in response  to the British  French  and American  refusal  for a loan  aimed  at building  the Aswan_High_Dam . 
The revenue  from the Canal, he argued , would help  finance  the High_Dam  project . 
The announcement  triggered  a swift  reaction  by Great_Britain  France  and Israel  who all invaded  Egypt  less  than two  months  later  
Their action  would be condemned  by the International  community  and Nasser  would eventually  claim  victory . 
In 1967 , the Canal  was closed  at the wake  of the SixDay_War  when Israel  occupied  the Sinai_Peninsula  causing  the Canal  to act  as a buffer zone  between the fighting  forces  
The Egyptians  reclaimed  the Canal  upon the 1973  ArabIsraeli_War  and the reopening ceremony  took_place  in 1975 . 
Since then the Canal  which stretches  167  kms  across the Egyptian  desert  has been widened  twice  
Today  approximately 50  ships  cross  the canal  daily  and, with the threat  of war  long  gone, the cities  and beaches  along the Bitter Lakes and the Canal  serve  as a summer  resort  for tourists  
Spanning  more_than  2000  km  along the northeastern  coast  of Australia  the Great_Barrier_Reef  is home to thousands  of species  of plants  and animals  
The Reef  which runs  parallel  to the Queensland  coast  has been designated  by the Australian  Government  as a Marine  Park  
 :76 :_Few  can imagine  the biological  diversity  of the reef  
One probably  has to realize  first  that the 2000  km  long  reef  runs  predominantly  in the NorthSouth direction  therefore  spanning  a wide  range  of climates  
Rain_forests  and mountains  are predominant  in the northern  islands  while the southern  islands  are composed  mainly  of Coral Cay 
Apart from its environmental  value  the area  offers  visitors  a variety  of activities  including  scuba_diving  snorkeling  water_sports  and birdwatching  
The Iguaçú Falls  are located in the Iguaçú National_Park  at the border  of Brazil  and Argentina  
In a horseshoe  form  2 ,700  meters  wide  between the two  countries  the Iguaçú Falls  fill the visitors  view  with the spray  of 72  meter high_falls   the number  of them varies  between 150  and 300 , depending  on the flow  of the Iguaçú River  
The panorama  overwhelms  the onlooker  with a sensation  of fright  fascination  and respect  for the perfection  of nature  
A visit  to the Falls  and the contact  with wildlife  and the spectacle  of the waters  awake an emotion  that many  hope  to experience  once  in a lifetime  
On 27  August  1883 , the Indonesian  island  of Rakata almost  vanished_ 
In_fact  about  75 % of the land  area  of Rakata no_longer  exists  
It was the most  violent  volcanic_eruption  recorded  in world  history  that caused  the destruction  and left  more_than  30 ,000  dead  
Krakatau  (Krakatoa ) volcano  was located on the island  of Rakata, 40_km  off the west coast of Java 
Since early  historic  ages  violent  volcanic  activity  has been known  to exist  in the region  
The "great  eruption " of Krakatau  must have taken_place  around 416  AD , as reported  in ancient  Javanese  scriptures  
The eruption  formed  three  Islands  (Rakata, Panjang, and Sertung), and caused  a 7  km  long  caldera  (cavity ) to form  underneath Rakata. 
When Krakatau  erupted  again  in 1883 , the island  virtually  collapsed  into its cavity  300  m  below  sea_level  
So violent  was the eruption  that volcanic  ash  and debris  reached  as far  west  as Madagascar  
Tidal_waves  resulted  in the destruction  of more_than  150  villages  and were felt  in France  and England  
 In Australia  hundreds  of kilometers  away  from the site  the explosion  was heard  
Since the disappearance  of Krakatau  smaller  eruptions  have been observed  
The ocean_floor  has been since gradually  rising , eventually  giving birth in 1927  to a new  island , north  of what remains  of Rakata. 
Today  Anak Krakatau (Son of Krakatau ) rises  more_than  150  m  above  sea_level  and is two  km  in diameter  
There are few  appropriate  superlatives  that have not  already  been applied  to this magnificent  natural  wonder  of the world ; in many  ways  it defies  description  
So  vast  are the Falls  and their setting  that it is difficult  to grasp  their true  grandeur  and for this reason  they are perhaps  best seen  from the air  
The Victoria_Falls  offer  an inescapable  closeness  to the natural  elements
