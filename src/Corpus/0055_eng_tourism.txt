 :4 : The building  is  not  normally  open  to the public , which makes  it the least  interesting  of the  Inns of Court .

 :26 : It has been said  that while sitting  on a broken  tomb  to eat  his lunch , he saw  a shaft  of sunlight  shine  through a crack  in the tomb  lid  and this led  him to imagine  what would happen  if the sunlight  awoke  the occupant  below .

 :49 : A fire  in 1834  destroyed  all but Westminster Hall  and the Jewel Tower  across the road , so the rest  of the present  building  is  surprisingly  new , having been built  in the period  1840 1860  to a mock Gothic  design .
 :50 : Strangely , the hall  tends  to be  ignored , except for on state  occasions .
 :51 : Visitors  to the public  gallery  do pass_through  the end  of the hall  on their way  in through the airport  style  security  checks .
