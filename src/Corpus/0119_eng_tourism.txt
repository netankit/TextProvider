Bangkok  and central  region  is  the major  rice  bowl  of the county , and many of the courses  have been carved  out of rice_paddies , compensating  for the flat  terrain  with beautiful  layouts  and lots  of water_hazards .

The island  of Samui has  the Samui Golf_Club  & Driving_Range , with professional  golf  instructor .
While spas  and meditation  are designed  to help  prevent  health_problems , a huge  business  is being generated  amongst those who already  have  problems , and need  treatment  in Thailand .

At_present , the cost  of getting  a medical_checkup  in Thailand  is  a fraction  of what it costs  in more  developed  countries .
Language  problems  notwithstanding , a number  of major  Thai  hospitals  have  learned the ropes  of the travel  business  and are marketing  themselves to also  regular  participants  at international  trade  shows , like ITB in Berlin  and the Arabian Travel Mart.

Thai  food  has become  in recent  years  one of the world  favorite  cuisines . 
When we speak  of "Thai  food  ", we are in_fact  talking  of four  very  distinct  regions  in the country , each with their own  culinary  traditions .
We are speaking  too  of the dishes  created  in the royal_courts  and palaces  of Old  Siam , that have been passed  down through many  generations  of chefs , and finally  into public_domain .
Good  food  also  comes_up  from the street  level , and many of Thailand  most  popular  dishes  can be found  at the smallest  food  stalls  and restaurants .
The influence  of China , India , Malaysia  and other  neighbouring  countries   all  these different  factors  come_together  under the label  "Thai  food ", and you will find  them in varying  degrees  at any  Thai  restaurant  you care  to visit , anywhere  in the world .
One of the most  distinctive  aspects  of the cuisine  is  its use  of herbs  and spices ;  with regard to  the spices , some  Thai  dishes  are  very  hot , but by_no_means  all of them.
The herbs  have  another  function , in_addition  to providing  flavour ,  in that  they all have  varying  degrees  of various  medical  and therapeutic  benefits .
Thailand  has  a long  history , going_back  to ancient  times , of the use  of herbs  for medical  purpose , and this in_turn  has permeated  the ways  of cooking  and preparing  food .
Coupled with its low fat  qualities  and its essential  freshness , this helps  make  Thai  food  one of the healthiest  anywhere .
Another  important  aspect  about Thai  food  is  the hospitality  and friendliness , the sheer  enjoyment  of good  companionship  and of eating  that is  such  a powerful  element  of the Thai  personality .
Sharing  a meal  is  an important  part  of the day  for any  Thai  person , and meals  are very  seldom  taken  alone , that is why all the dishes  are generally  served  at_once  during Thai  meal , and why there is  a communal  spoon  placed  alongside  each  dish  for people  to help  themselves and to serve  others.
A Thai  meal  ideally  is  a communal  affair , principally  because the greater  the number  of diners  the greater  the number  of dishes  that can be sampled .
Diners  choose  whatever  they require  from shared  dishes  and generally  add  it to their own  plate  of rice .
All  the dishes  are served  simultaneously , or nearly  so .   
The object  is  to achieve  a harmonious  blend  of the spicy , the subtle , the sweet  and the sour , and a meal  is meant  to be  equally  satisfying  to the eye , nose  and palate .
Thailand  is  blessed  with many  varieties  of plants , herbs  and spices  which ensure  a balanced_diet .
Today , visitors  can relish  both the classic  Thai  menus  and the benefits  of a natural  diet , and study  the art  of Thai  cooking  at several  specialist  schools  in Bangkok  and major  beach  resorts .
The Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya or Ayutthaya is  one of Thailand  historical  and majestic  highlights .
Serving  as the Thai  capital  for 417  years  (1350  1767 : Kingdom  of Ayutthaya), it was once  glorified  as one of the biggest  cities  in Southeast_Asia .
During the 17 th  century , most  foreign  visitors  to Ayutthaya, traders  or diplomats  alike , claimed  Ayutthaya to be  the most  illustrious  and glittering  city  that they had ever  visited .
The map  of Ayutthaya published  in 1691  by Simon de la Loubere in 
Du Royaume De Siam is  proof  of such  recognition .
The Kingdom  of Ayutthaya reached  its apex  in terms of sovereignty , military  might , wealth , culture , and international  commerce  in the 16 th  century  when the Kingdom  territory  was extended  far  beyond presentday  Laos , Cambodia , and Myanmar . 
Ayutthaya even  had  diplomatic  relations  with 
Louis_XIV  of France  and was courted  by Dutch , Portuguese , English , Chinese  and Japanese  merchants .
Visitors  can explore  and appreciate  Thai  history  in Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, which is  situated  only  86  kilometers  north  of Bangkok .
Visitors  to Ayutthaya can marvel  at its grandeur  reflected  through numerous  magnificent  structures  and ruins  concentrated  in and around the city  island  surrounded  by Maenam Chao_Phraya , Maenam Pa Sak and Maenam Lopburi.
More  importantly , Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Historical  Park , an extensive  historical  site  in the heart  of Ayutthaya city , has been included  in UNESCO  World  Heritage  list  since 13  December , 1991 .
The Kingdom  of Ayutthaya was built  and developed  in 
 leaps and bounds .
The ruins  in Ayutthaya that survived  the test  of time  embody  both  the glorious  and ignominious  stories  of the Kingdom .
Ancient  capital  of the Kingdom  of Ayutthaya, founded  in 1350  by King  UThong, had  thirty_three  kings  of different  dynasties  and reached  its peak  in the middle  of the18 th  century .
A magnificent  city  with three  palaces  and over 400  magnificent  temples  on an island  threaded by canals  Ayutthaya was  truly  an impressive  city  that attracted  both  Europeans  and Asians .
After a 15 month  siege , the Kingdom  of Ayutthaya was conquered  and completely  destroyed  by the Burmese  in 1767 .
When King  Taksin the Great  finally  liberated  the Kingdom , a new  dynasty  was established  and the capital  was moved  to Thonburi.
The seal  of Ayutthaya depicts  a conch  on a pedestal  tray  placed  in a small  castle  under a Mun tree .
According  to legend , King  UThong, founder  of the Kingdom  of Ayutthaya, discovered  a beautiful  conch  buried  in the ground  being prepared  for the establishment  of the seat  of his Kingdom .
Today , there are  but  groups  of crumbling  ruins  and rows  of headless  Buddhas  where once  an empire  thrived .
The temple  compounds  are  still  aweinspiring  even  in disrepair  and a visit  here  is  memorable  and a good  beginning  for those drawn  to the relics  of history .
 The architecture  of Ayutthaya is  a fascinating  mix  of Khmer (ancient  Cambodian  style ) and early  Sukhothai style .
Some  cactus shaped  obelisks , called  Prang, denote  Khmer influence  and look  something  like the famous  towers  of Angkor Wat.
For new  arrivals  who had limited  their visit  to Bangkok , similarities  may be noted  with the riverside  Wat Arun, an 18 th century  structure  that was built  in the socalled  Ayutthaya style , a melding  of Sukhothai Buddhist  influences  and Hindu inspired  Khmer motifs .
Ayutthaya is  administratively  divided  into 16  districts : Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, Ban Phraek, Bang Ban, Bang Pahan, Bang Pain, Amphoe Bang Sai, Bang Sai, Lat Bua Luang, Maha Rat, Nakhon Luang, Phachi, PhakHai, Sena, Tha Rua, Uthai and Wang Noi.
Phetchaburi, locally  known  by Thais  as Muang Phetch, is  located  160  kilometers  south  of Bangkok .
One of Thailand  central  region  provinces , Phetchaburi is  situated  on the western  shore  of the 
Gulf_of_Thailand  with an overall  area  of approximately  6 ,225   square kilometers .
Phetchaburi's terrains  throughout the western  border , where Tanaosri Range  lies  as a natural  border  between Thailand  and Myanmar , are  mountainous  dense  jungles .
A very  old  city  which used  to be  an important  royal  fort  town , Phetchaburi had been given  several  names  such as, Phripphri, Phripphli or Phetchaphli.
Some  historians  have gone  as far as to say  that Phetchaburi could have been named  in Indian  style , as the Indian  influence  in those days  was  strong .
Others put_forward  the idea  that the name  Phetchaburi might have originated  from Maenam Phetch the most  important  river  of the town .
Whatever  the assumptions  are , the fact  that Phetchaburi is  an ancient  city  with a very  long  history  is  undeniable  and this has been proven  by many  archaeological  findings  which could be dated_back  to the Dvaravati Period .
During Sukhothai and Ayutthaya Kingdoms , Phetchaburi was  a strategic  royal  fort  in the west .
Only  a lineage  of Kings  had  the rights  to rule  this historical  city ; that is  why  Phetchaburi has been called  by some  scholars  as the "Living  Ayutthaya" as the town  shares  many  similar  things  to the City  of Ayutthaya.
The prosperity  of the Ayutthaya Kingdom  can be seen  and appreciated  in Phetchaburi's wealth  of fine  old  temples .
In the Rattanakosin era , Phetchaburi has changed  its character  to a town  of charming  beauty , with peaceful  seaside  resorts  and superb  natural  reserves .
 :110 : The three  Kings  of the Rattanakosin Period , King  Rama IV, V, and VI established  their retreats  here  and they built  the three  palaces  namely  Phranakhonkhiri, Phraramrajanivet, Phrarajnivesmarugadayawan in Phetchaburi, thus  Phetchaburi is  also  known_as  Muang Sam Wang (the city  of the three  Palaces ).
 :111 : The province  is  also  well_known  for its splendid  historical  park , ancient  temples , wonderful  beaches  and caves , as well as a great  variety  of local  and fresh  seafood .
 :112 : Phetchaburi also  has  a popular  resort  town , Chaam which is  the premier  beach  resort  in the province .
