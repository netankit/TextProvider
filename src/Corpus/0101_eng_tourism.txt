The more  adventurous  sort  of amusement  has now  become  an alternative  sport  for tourists .
Meanwhile  white_water  rafting  is  still  a popular  activity  with trips  on Ayung, Telaga Waja, Unda rivers , etc. . 
The tourists  can refresh  their mind  by watching  the beautiful  scenery  along the route .
If these are  not  enough , some of the best  surfing  beaches  in the world  can be found  on the western  side  of the island  whilst conversely  the eastern  side  is  a wonderful  haven  for families , with beautiful  white  sand  beaches  and gentle  seas .
Bali  is  a small  island , just  140  km  by 80  km  and lies  between Java , the most  highly  populated  and influential  of all  the islands , and Lombok, one of the quieter  and moderately  slower  paced  islands .
Like many  islands , Bali  has developed  a world  of its own .
It not_only  captures  what is  special  about Indonesia  but also  has  a uniqueness  of its own .
The culture  of Bali  is  unique . 
People  say  that the  Balinese  people  have  reached  self content .
The  Balinese  people  are  proud  of having preserved  their unique  Hindu  culture  against the advance  of Islam , the dominant  religion  throughout Indonesia .
Its unique  Hindu  culture  is still  reflected  in the day_to_day  life  and can be seen  in the numerous  ceremonies ,  Balinese  festivals  and magnificent  temples  and palaces .
The  Balinese  are  skilled  artisans , particularly  in woodcarving  and in fashioning  objects  of tortoiseshell  and of gold , silver  and other  metals .
The  Balinese  are  noted  for their traditional  dance , the distinctive  music  of the gamelan  and for their skills  in weaving  cloth  of gold  and silver  threads , Songket, as well as for embroidering  silk  and cotton  clothing .
Stone  and woodcarvings , traditional  and modern  paintings  and intricately  designed  jewelry  in gold  and silver  are  readily  available  in shops  and galleries  throughout the island .
As for recreation , there is  no  shortage  of options 
Nature  walks , horseback_riding , diving , surfing   even   bungee jumping  and white_water  rafting   await  the adventurous  here .
Bali  is  volcanically  active  and extravagantly  fertile . 
Bali  has  an area  of 5620   sq km , measures  approximately  140  km  by 80  km  and is  just  8  degrees  south  of the equator .
Mount  Agung known_as  the 'mother  mountain ' is  over 3000  meters . 
South  and north  of the central  mountains  are  Bali  fertile  agricultural  lands .
The southern  region  is  a wide , gently  sloping  area  where most of Bali  abundant  rice  crop  is grown .
The southcentral  area  is  the true  rice  basket  of the island . 
The northern  coastal  strip  is  narrower , rising  more  rapidly  into the foothills  of the central  range , but the main  export  crops , coffee , copra  and rice , are grown  here . Cattle  are also  raised  in this area .
Bali  has  a climate  that is  tropical  all  year . 
The average  temperature  hovers  around  30  degrees_Celsius  yearround .
There are  dry  and wet  seasons   dry  from April  to September  and wet  from October  to March   but it can rain  at any  time  of the year  and even  during the wet  season  rain  is  likely  to pass  quickly .
In_general  May  to August  are  the best  months  in Bali.
At that time  of the year  the climate  is  likely  to be  cooler  and the rains  lightest . 
Around the coast , sea_breezes  temper  the heat  and as we move  inland  we also  move  up  so the altitude  works  to keep  things  cool .
It can get  very  cool  up in the highlands  and a warm  sweater  can be  a good  idea  in mountain  villages  like Kintamani or Bedugul.
With 2 .5  million  people , Bali  is  a very  densely  populated  island .
The population  is  almost  all  Indonesian , with the usual  small  Chinese  contingent  in the big  towns , a sprinkling  of Indian  merchants , plus a number  of more_or_less  permanent  visitors  amongst the westerners  in Bali .
Each  stage  of  Balinese  life  is marked  by a series  of ceremonies  and rituals  known_as  Manusa Yadnya.
They contribute  to the rich , varied  and active  life  the average   Balinese  leads .
There are  ceremonies  for every  stage  of  Balinese  life  but often  the last  cremation  ceremony  is  the biggest .
A  Balinese  cremation  can be  an amazing , spectacular , colorful , noisy  and exciting  event .  I
In_fact  it often  takes  so  long  to organize  a cremation  that years   pass  since the death .
Of_course  an auspicious  day  must be chosen  for the cremation  and since a big  cremation  can be   a very  expensive business  many  less  wealthy  people  may take  the opportunity  of joining  in at a larger  cremation  and sending  their own  dead  on their way  at_the_same_time .
Apart from being  yet  another  occasion  for  Balinese  noise  and confusion  it's a fine  opportunity  to observe  the incredible  energy  the  Balinese  put  into creating  real  works_of_art  which are  totally  ephemeral .
The body  is carried  from the burial_ground  (or from the deceased  home  if it's an 'immediate ' cremation ) to the cremation  ground  in a high ,  multi tiered  tower  made  of bamboo , paper , string , tinsel , silk , cloth , mirrors , flowers  and anything  else  bright  and colorful  we can think_of .
The tower  is carried  on the shoulders  of a group  of men : the size  of the group  depending  on the importance  of the deceased  and hence  the size  of the tower .
The funeral  of a former  rajah  high_priest  may require  hundreds  of men  to tote  the tower .
Banten is  one of the young  provinces  in the 
Republic_of_Indonesia .
This region  is  situated  in west  Java . 
It can be reached  in about  an hour  from Jakarta .
It feels  unbelievable , after the busy   tollway  and hectic  Jakarta  metropolitan  city , as we enter  the small  and charming  Banten.

From this place , Sultan  Banten's troopers  fought  against the pirates  and defended  against  the Dutch .

Cirebon is  located  on the border  between West  and Central  Java , having  a mixed  culture  originating  from the ancient  Cirebon and Banten kingdoms , resulting  in similar  customs  and dialects  of the two  people , although Banten city  is  located  at the extreme  western  part  of the province .
