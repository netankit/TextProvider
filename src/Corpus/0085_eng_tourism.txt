Handicrafts  Bhavan, Baba Kharak Singh Marg: a relatively  new  complex  that’s come_up  between the state  emporia ,  is  chockablock  with the  crafts  stalls  of several  NGO s.
On offer  is  an amazing  range  of contemporary  style  handicrafts   sleeker  and definitely  more  innovative  than anything  you’ll see  in the state  emporia . 
M Block  Market  Greater Kailash, Part  I , is  one of Delhi's swankiest  markets , and a hangout  zone  for the young  and the trendy .
Shopping  here  is  a cash  intensive  affair , but the range  is  wide  and quality  great , especially  good  for shoes , bags , jewellery , clothes , skincare  products  and cosmetics .
Ambawatta is  no_longer  the hub  of designer  stores  but the action  now  seems  to have moved  to the Crescent (near Qutub), Garden  of the Five  Sense (off  Saket), and Lodhi Colony.
Chandigarh, the first  modern  and planned  city  of India , is  unique  in many  ways .
Chandigarh is  dynamic  and vibrant  and its unique  architectural  signature , excellent  town_planning , serene  and clean  environment , offsets  its cosmopolitan  character .
Chandigarh is  located  in the foothill  of the Shivalik Hills  as a  gateway  to the Himalayas ; it is  one of India ’s success  stories  it is  a veritable  tourist  paradise . 
With a view  to making  Chandigarh a favoured  destination , the Chandigarh Administration  will focus  on adding  new  features  and strengthening  the network  of tourism  related  support  services  and the Film  Festival  as well as the traditional  Rose Festival  and Chandigarh Carnival , are  all   mustsees . 
Perhaps  our biggest  and most  exciting  plan  is  the  mega  Theme  cum Amusement_Park  on the outskirts  of Chandigarh and a Multimedia  cum Film  city  and we are expecting  at_least  a million  visitors  to the Theme_Park  annually . 
Taj Chandigarh, Sector 17  A, is  undoubtedly  the best  stay  option  in the city , certainly  located  with some  great , popular  restaurants .
The ambience  of the Dera restaurant  is  as  far  removed  from the Dhabas of the city  as possible  but it is  a great  place  to sample  the robust   non vegetarian  cuisine  of Punjab  and the NorthWest  Frontier . 
Opt  for Black Lotus if you want  some  great  Oriental  food  and the rooms  here  are  plush , spacious  and the personalized  service  makes  all the difference .
The Kaptain's Retreat , Sector 35 B: that the  hotel  is  partly  owned  by the city  best_known  resident , Kapil Dev, is  reason  enough  for some  people  to stay  here .
With cricketing  memorabilia  strewn  all_over  the place , The Kaptain's Retreat   will be  of special  interest  to those who love  the game  and will have  the chance  to sleep  in rooms  named  after Kapil Dev's individual  cricketing  achievements  such as 432  (his  test wickets ) and Four   Sixes  (the reason  for this one, you should ask  English  cricketer  Eddie Hemmings). 
At the smart   multi  cuisine  restaurant  called  Elevens , neighbors  and arch  rivals  in the game , India  and Pakistan , find  themselves on the menu  trying  to outdo  each other even  here , in the kebabs  and meat  varieties .
North Park , Panchkula: you may not  have heard  of this one, and the reason  is  that the few  people  who frequent  this hotel  keep  it a well  guarded  secret : situated  in an idyllic  location , removed  from the bustle  of the city , this hotel , nestling  unassumingly  at the foothills  of the Shivalik range , is  a charming  and quiet   getaway .  
North Park  is  a great  favourite  with those who know  its somewhat  out_of_the_way  location , peace  and tranquility  is  very_much  a part  of the  package  here , as  nothing but  birdsong  and the gush  of the Ghaggar river  flowing  by disturb  the calm , although rooms  are   basic  yet offer  all  amenities ; and the service  is  as  good  as it gets .
Hot Millions, one of the popular  restaurant  in Chandigarh, has defined  fast_food  dining  in Chandigarh for decades . 
The food  and service  are  both excellent  and  their pub  Down Under in Sector 35  captures  some of the changes  in the city  as a younger  generation  seeks  to shed  the city  image  as a home  for pensioners . 
One of the best  restaurants  in the city , Khyber serves  finger  licking  good  Indian  cuisine .
The ambience  is  rustic , in keeping  with the ruggedness  of the terrain  after which the restaurant  is  named , and the food  is served  straight  off  the fire, without fancy  garnishes . 
A variety  of Kebab  and innovative  vegetarian  dishes  spice_up  the menu . 
The malai tangri kebab  and palak paneer here  are  especially  recommended . 
Caught_up  in the vision  of Chandigarh as a modern  city , people  often  overlook  the great  dhaba food  that is  available  within the city .
Pal and Swaran Dhaba top  the list  for some  great  non  vegetarian  fare , especially  the mutton  apart from standard  dhaba dishes  such as dal makhni.
Another must   checkout  is  Tehsil Singh Ka Dhaba, a great  favourite  with  locals .
Noodle Bar, a new  restaurant  is fast  becoming  everyone's favourite  for Oriental  food  and try_out  the many  different  types  of noodles  they can make , or simply  order  the plain  old  chilli  chicken , it’s all  guaranteed  to be  delicious . 
Traditional  and ceramic  pottery  can be found  in abundance  at the Kumbhar Colony area , where a group  of potters  come  together  to make  some  simple , beautiful  creations .
Sector 17  is  the main  shopping_centre  of the city , with rows  of glittering  showrooms . 
Where all  the action  is  most  great  restaurants , almost  all  big  stores  and some  pubs  and clubs  are all  located  at Sector 17  market  complex .
Most of the handicrafts  available , pots  and curios  are  conveniently  sized  and make  for great  gifts . 
The Rose Festival   a three  day  extravaganza , held  usually  in the last  week  of February , which brings  the city  of Chandigarh alive .

The Heritage Festival  was celebrated  for the first  time  last  year  in October , with the aim  of promoting  the city  unique  gifts  of ‘modern  heritage ’ something  that has put  Chandigarh on the tentative  list  of UNESCO  World  Heritage  walk  along  the Capital Complex  in Sector 1 , highlighting   Le Corbrsier's wonderful  design  and architecture .
