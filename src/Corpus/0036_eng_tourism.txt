There , he sculpted  and carved  the different  pieces  of the statue  before they were assembled  in the temple . 
When the statue  was completed , it barely  fitted  in the temple . 
Strabo wrote : â€œalthough the temple  itself is  very  large , the sculptor  is criticized  for not  having appreciated  the correct  proportions ."
 :3 :  :3 :  He has shown  Zeus  seated , but with the head  almost  touching  the ceiling , so that we have  the impression  that if Zeus  moved  to stand_up  he would  unroof  the temple ." 
 :4 : Strabo was  right , except that the sculptor  is to be commended , not  criticized . 
 :5 : It is  this size  impression  that made  the statue  so  wonderful .
 :6 :  It is  the idea  that the king  of gods  is  capable  of  unroofing  the temple  if he stood_up  that fascinated  poets  and historians  alike . 
 :7 : The base  of the statue  was  about  6 .5  m  (20  ft ) wide  and 1 .0  meter  (3  ft ) high . 
The height  of the statue  itself was  13  m  (40  ft ), equivalent  to a modern  4 story  building . 
 :8 :  :8 : The statue  was  so  high  that visitors  described  the throne  more_than  Zeus  body  and features .
 :9 :  The legs  of the throne  were  decorated  with sphinxes  and winged  figures  of  Victory .
 :10 : Greek  gods  and mythical  figures  also  adorned  the scene : Apollo , Artemis  and Niobe  children . 
 :11 :  In his right_hand  he holds  a figure  of  Victory  made  from ivory  and gold .
 :12 : In his left_hand , he holds  a scepter  inlaid  with every  kind  of metal , with an eagle  perched  on the scepter .
 :13 : His sandals  are made  of gold , as is  his robe . 
His garments  are carved  with animals  and with lilies . 
 :14 :  :14 : The throne  is  decorated  with gold , precious_stones , ebony  and ivory . 
 :15 : The statue  was  occasionally  decorated  with gifts  from kings  and rulers  and the most  notable  of these gifts  was  a woolen  curtain  "adorned  with  Assyrian  woven  patterns  and Phoenician  dye " which was dedicated  by the Syrian  king  Antiochus IV. 
 :16 : Copies  of the statue  were made , including  a large  prototype  at Cyrene (Libya ). 
 :17 : None of them, however , survived  to the present_day . 
 :18 : Early  reconstructions  such as the one by Von Erlach are now  believed  to be  rather  inaccurate . 
 :19 : For us, we can only  wonder  about the true  appearance  of the statue   the greatest  work  in Greek  sculpture .
 :20 :  Dedicatory  inscription  of the Lighthouse .
 :21 : Of the Seven  Wonders  of the Ancient  World , only  one  had  a practical  use  in_addition  to its architectural  elegance   The Lighthouse  of Alexandria .
 :22 :  For sailors , it ensured  a safe  return  to the Great  Harbor . 
 :23 : For architects , it meant  even  more : it was  the tallest  building  on Earth  and for scientists , it was  the mysterious  mirror  that fascinated  those most .
 :24 : In the mirror  reflections  could be seen  more_than  50  km  (35  miles ) offshore , on the ancient  island  of Pharos, now  a promontory  within the city  of Alexandria  in Egypt . 
 :26 : Shortly  after the death  of Alexander_the_Great , his commander  Ptolemy Soter assumed  power  in Egypt . 
 :27 : He had witnessed  the founding  of Alexandria  and established  his capital  there . 
Off the city  coast  lies  a small  island    Pharos. 
 :28 : Its name , legend  says , is  a variation  of Pharaoh  Island , but it is  more  likely  that the name  is  Greek  in origin . 
 :29 : The island  was  connected  to the mainland  by means  of a dike   the Heptastadion  which gave  the city  a double  harbor . 
 :30 : And because of dangerous  sailing  conditions  and flat  coastline  in the region , the construction  of a lighthouse  was  necessary . 
 :31 : The project  was conceived  and initiated  by Ptolemy Soter around  290  BC , but was completed  after his death , during the reign  of his son  Ptolemy Philadelphus. 
 :33 : Sostratus, a contemporary  of Euclid , was  the architect , but detailed  calculations  for the structure  and its accessories  were carried_out  at the Alexandria  Library /Mouseion. 
 :34 : The monument  was dedicated  to the Savior  Gods   Ptolemy Soter (literally  savior ) and his wife  Berenice. 
 :35 : For centuries , the Lighthouse  of Alexandria  (occasionally  referred  to as the Pharos Lighthouse ) was used  to mark  the harbor , using  fire  at night  and reflecting  sun_rays  during the day . 
It was even  shown  on Roman  coins , just  as famous  monuments  are depicted  on currency  today . 
 :37 : When the Arabs  conquered  Egypt , they admired  Alexandria  and its wealth . 
 :38 : The Lighthouse  continues  to be mentioned  in their writings  and travelers  accounts .
 :39 :  But the new  rulers  moved  their capital  to Cairo  since they had  no  ties  to the Mediterranean . 
 :40 : When the mirror  was brought_down  mistakenly , they did not  restore  it back  into its place . 
 :41 : In AD  956 , an earthquake  shook  Alexandria , and caused  little  damage  to the Lighthouse .
 :42 :  It was  later  in 1303  and in 1323  that two  stronger  earthquakes  left  a significant  impression  on the structure .
 :43 :  When the famous  Arab  traveler  Ibn Battuta visited  Alexandria  in 1349 , he could not  enter  the  ruinous  monument  or even  climb  to its doorway . 
 :44 : The final  chapter  in the history  of the Lighthouse  came  in AD  1480  when the Egyptian  Mamelouk Sultan , Qaitbay, decided  to fortify  Alexandria  defense .
 :45 : He built  a medieval  fort  on the same  spot  where the Lighthouse  once  stood , using  the fallen  stone  and marble . 
 :46 : Of the six  vanished  wonders , the Lighthouse  of Alexandria  was  the last  to disappear . 
 :47 : Therefore  we have  adequately  accurate  knowledge  of its location  and appearance . 
 :48 : Ancient  accounts  such as those by Strabo and Pliny_the_Elder  give  us a brief  description  of the "tower " and the magnificent  white  marble  cover . 
 :49 : They tell  us how the mysterious  mirror  could reflect  the light  tens  of kilometers  away . 
 :50 : Legend  says  the mirror  was also  used  to detect  and burn  enemy  ships  before they could reach  the shore .
 :51 : In 1166 , an Arab  traveler , AbouHaggag AlAndaloussi visited  the Lighthouse . 
 :52 : He documented  a wealth  of information  and gave  an accurate  description  of the structure  which helped  modern  archeologists  reconstruct  the monument .
 :53 : The lowest  square , 55 .9  m  (183 .4  ft ) high  with a cylindrical  core ; the middle  octagonal  with a side  length  of 18 .30  m  (60 .0  ft ) and a height  of 27 .45  m  (90 .1  ft ); and the third  circular  7 .30  m  (24 .0  ft ) high . 
 :54 : The total  height  of the building  including  the foundation  base  was  about  117  m  (384  ft ), equivalent  to a 40 story  modern  building . 
 :55 : The internal  core  was used  as a shaft  to lift  the fuel  needed  for the fire . 
 :56 : At the top  stage , the mirror  reflected  sunlight  during the day  while fire  was used  during the night .
 :57 :  In ancient  times , a statue  of Poseidon  adorned  the summit  of the building . 
 :58 : Although the Lighthouse  of Alexandria  did not  survive  to the present_day , it left  its influence  in various  respects . 
 :59 : From an architectural  standpoint , the monument  has been used  as a model  for many  prototypes  along the Mediterranean , as  far_away  as Spain . 
 :60 : And from a linguistic  standpoint , it gave  its name   Pharos   to all  the lighthouses  in the world .
 :61 : Just  look_up  the dictionary  for the French , Italian , or Spanish  word  for lighthouse .
 :62 : Similar  to the Great_Pyramid , we are now  visiting  the burial  place  of an ancient  king . 
 :63 : Yet  the Mausoleum  is  different   so  different  from the Pyramid  that it earned  its reputation   and a spot  within the list   for other  reasons . 
 :64 : Geographically , it is  closer  to the Temple_of_Artemis .
 :65 : And it was  the beauty  of the tomb  rather  than its size  that fascinated  its visitors  for years . 
 :66 : It is  located  In the city  of Bodrum (a.k.a.  Halicarnassus ) on the Aegean_Sea , in southwest  Turkey . 
 :67 : When the Persians  expanded  their ancient  kingdom  to include  Mesopotamia , Northern  India , Syria , Egypt  and Asia_Minor , the king  could not  control  his vast  empire  without the help  of local  governors  or rulers   the Satraps . 
 :68 : Like many  other  provinces , the kingdom  of Caria in the western  part  of Asia_Minor  (Turkey ) was  so  far  from the Persian  capital  that it was  practically  autonomous .
 :69 :  From 377  to 353  BC , king  Mausollos of Caria reigned  and moved  his capital  to Halicarnassus . 
 :70 : Nothing  is  exciting  about Maussollos life  except the construction  of his tomb .
 :71 :  The project  was conceived  by his wife  and sister  Artemisia, and the construction  might have started  during the king  lifetime . 
 :72 : The Mausoleum  was completed  around  350  BC , three  years  after Maussollos death , and one  year  after Artemisia's. 
 :73 : For 16  centuries , the Mausoleum  remained  in good  condition  until an earthquake  caused  some  damage  to the roof  and colonnade .
 :74 :  In the early  fifteenth  century , the Knights  of St John of Malta  invaded  the region  and built  a massive  crusader  castle . 
 :75 : When they decided  to fortify  it in 1494 , they used  the stones  of the Mausoleum . 
By 1522 , almost  every  block  of the Mausoleum  had been disassembled  and used  for construction . 
 :76 :  :76 : Today , the massive  castle  still  stands  in Bodrum, and the polished  stone  and marble  blocks  of the Mausoleum  can be spotted  within the walls  of the structure . 
 :77 : Some of the sculptures  survived  and are  today  on display  at the British  Museum  in London .
 :78 : These include  fragment  of statues  and many  slabs  of the frieze  showing  the battle  between the Greeks  and the Amazons . 
 :79 : At the site  of the Mausoleum  itself, only  the foundation  remains  of the once  magnificent  Wonder . 
 :80 : The structure  was  rectangular  in plan , with base  dimensions  of about  40  m  (120  ft ) by 30  m  (100  ft ).
 :81 : Overlying  the foundation  was  a stepped  podium  whose sides  were decorated  with statues . 
 :82 : The burial_chamber  and the sarcophagus  of white  alabaster  decorated  with gold  were  located  on the podium  and surrounded  by Ionic  columns .
 :83 :  The colonnade  supported  a pyramid  roof  which was  in_turn  decorated  with statues . 
 :84 : A statue  of a chariot  pulled  by four  horses  adorned  the top  of the tomb . 
 :85 : The total  height  of the Mausoleum  was  45  m  (140  ft ). 
 :86 : This is broken_down  into 20  m  (60  ft ) for the stepped  podium , 12  m  (38  ft ) for the colonnade , 7  m  (22  ft ) for the pyramid , and 6  m  (20  ft ) for the chariot  statue  at the top . 
 :87 : The beauty  of the Mausoleum  is  not_only  in the structure  itself, but in the decorations  and statues  that adorned  the outside  at different  levels  on the podium  and the roof .
 :88 :  These were  tens  of lifesize  as well as under and over lifesize  freestanding  statues  of people , lions , horses  and other  animals . 
 :89 : The statues  were carved  by four  Greek  sculptors : Bryaxis, Leochares, Scopas, and Timotheus, each responsible  for one  side . 
 :90 : Because the statues  were  of people  and animals , the Mausoleum  holds  a special  place  in history  as it was  not  dedicated  to the gods  of ancient  Greece . 
 :91 : Since the nineteenth  century , archeological  excavations  have been undertaken  at the Mausoleum  site .
 :92 :  These excavations  together with detailed  descriptions  by ancient  historians  give  us a fairly  good  idea  about the shape  and appearance  of the Mausoleum .
 :93 :  A modern  reconstruction  of the shorter  side  of the Mausoleum  illustrates  the lavish  nature  of the art  and architecture  of the building   a building  for a King  whose name  is celebrated  in all  large  tombs  today   mausoleums . 
 :94 : From its building  to its destruction  lies  a time  span  of merely  56  years . 
 :95 : Yet  the  Colossus  earned  a place  in the famous  list  of Wonders . 
"But even  lying  on the ground , it is  a marvel ", said  Pliny_the_Elder . 
 :96 :  :96 : The Colossus_of_Rhodes  was  not_only  a gigantic  statue ,
 :97 :  it was  rather  a symbol  of unity  of the people  who inhabited  that beautiful  Mediterranean  island   Rhodes . 
 :98 : At the entrance  of the harbor  of the Mediterranean  island  of Rhodes  in Greece . 
 :99 : Throughout most of its history , ancient  Greece  was comprised  of citystates  which had limited  power  beyond their boundary . 
 :100 : On the small  island  of Rhodes  were  three  of these: Lalysos, Kamiros, and Lindos. 
 :101 : In 408  BC , the cities  united  to form  one  territory , with a unified  capital , Rhodes .
