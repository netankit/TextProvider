Meditation  is found  in some  form  or another  in all  major  religious  traditions  but in Buddhism  it is  integral  to the path  to enlightenment . 
The practitioner  trains  his or her mind  so that it can understand  the four points  that form  the core  of the Buddha ’s teaching : suffering , what causes  it, the end  of suffering , and the path  to that end .
Consequently , the art  of meditation  is  a highly  developed  one in Thailand  and one doesn’t need  to be  a Buddhist , or even  be  interested  in Buddhism , to benefit  from meditation .
A valuable  training  that can be applied  to daily  life , it greatly  helps  concentration  and can lead  to a state  of peace  and calmness , no_matter  where the meditation  is performed .
There are  two  main  branches  in Buddhist  meditation : Samatha (calmness , concentration ) and Vipassana (insight ), which stresses  mindfulness  in Thailand .
The techniques  of Samatha meditation  are  many, some of them older  than Buddhism  itself. 
Amongst the most  commonly  practiced  in Thailand  is  Anapanasati, or “mindfulness  with breathing ”. 
Mantra  meditation , in which  given  words  are repeated  over_and_over  to help  focus  the mind , is  also  widely  practiced . 
Kasinas, where  meditator  concentrate  on an object  outside themselves, such as a crystal_ball  and candle_flame , is  yet  another  form .
Sati, or mindfulness , is  the key  to Vipassana meditation .
When the mind  is  untrained  it is  wide  open  to outside  disturbances , and the objective  is  to be  aware  of what happens  but not  dwell  upon it. 
So you train  yourself to be  aware  of the body ’s movement , the rise  and fall  of the chest  as you inhale  and exhale , the movement  of the legs  and feet  as you walk , and your feelings  and state  of mind .
Walking , sitting  and lying  meditation  are  a few of the Vipassana techniques , and to avoid  distractions  as far as possible  the retreats  are  usually  held  in isolated  and peaceful  surroundings .
Meditation  teachings  are  widely  available  in Thailand  for Thais  and visitors  alike , ranging  from English_language  day  classes  in Bangkok  through to intensive  monthlong  Vipassana courses  at remote  retreats  in the provinces .
Thailand ’s cultural  heritage  was influenced  by ancient  India  when the Indian  merchants  and scholars   set foot in  and gradually  settled  in Southeast_Asia  some  2 ,300  years  ago . 
Buddhist  religion  and popular  myth  are  the most  obvious  examples  and much of Thailand ’s royal  tradition  is also  rooted  in Indian  culture .
Buddhism  is thought  to have first  come  to Thailand  at Nakhon Pathom, while Indian  concepts  of divine  kingship  first  took_root  in the Khmer empire .
By the 6 th  century  AD , many  independent  states  were flourishing  in the region  we now  know  as Thailand . 
One of these was  the Mon  Dvaravati kingdom .
Mon  dominance  over central  Thailand  has been diminished  by the power  of an expanding  Khmer empire . 
Eventually , the Khmer  became  so  powerful  that they ruled  the entire  area .
Only  the southern  isthmus  where the Srivijaya civilization  had taken_root  was  unaffected  by the Indian  culture .
Towards the end  of the 13 th  century , Khmer power  in this area  waned  and new  kingdoms  dominated  by the Thai  race  developed , including  the northern  Lanna kingdom .
Beginning  by nibbling  away  at the perimeter  of the Khmer empire  at Sukhothai and in Lanna some  700  years  ago , the Thai  race  later  established  the glorious  court  at Ayutthaya, and eventually  Bangkok .
Over the past  centuries , many  peoples , among them the Chinese , Arabs , Malays  and Westerners , have contributed  to Thailand ’s cultural  heritage .
Thailand ’s majestic  cultural  heritage  inherited  over the past  centuries  was dominated  or influenced  by many  kingdoms  encompassing  the area  including  the powerful  Khmer.
The remains  of their cultural  heritage  can still  be seen  in many  places  through out the  kingdom .
The best  example  of Khmer culture  is  at Phimai, some  60  kilometres  northeast  of Nakhon Ratchhasima.
 :70 : The old  temple  stands  in the middle  of the modern  town . 
The outlines  of the old  fortified  town  can still  be traced 
It was  strictly  rectangular  in plan , as were  all  Khmer settlements , and it was made  doubly  secure  by placing  it on an artificial  island . 
The nearby  Phanom Rung and Muang Tham sanctuaries  are also  two  good  examples  Khmer culture .
Other  outstanding  Khmer treasures  in Thailand  include  the powerfully  evocative  sanctuary  at Muang Singh in Kanchanaburi, and the imposing  triple spire  shrines  at Lop Buri.
Davaravati culture  was centred  on the area  between Nakhon Pathom, a little , fortified  town  some  50  kilometers  west  of Bangkok , and UThong to the north .
Davaravati culture ’s enduring  emblem  is  Phra Pathom Chedi, the massive  bellshaped  Buddhist  shrine  with its golden  spire  at Nakhon Pathom.
Buddhism  is believed  first  to have been taught  in Thailand . 
The Chedi, at 120 .45  meters , is  the tallest  Buddhist  structure  in the world .
Lanna Kingdom : Founded  by King  Mengrai, the northern  Lanna kingdom  had  an exciting  mixture  of cultures  due_to  its diverse  populations  and mountainous  location . 
The main  division was  between the farmers  and townspeople  of the valleys  and the hill  tribes  themselves represent  several  very  distinct  ethnic  stocks , so that a multitude  of languages , customs , beliefs , architectures , diets , and styles  of dress  exist  harmoniously  side_by_side .
Sukhothai Kingdom , some  480  kilometers  north  of Bangkok , was  the capital  of the first  truly  Thai  kingdom .
Sukhotha’s third  king , the great  Ramkhamhaeng, is credited  with devising  the Thai  alphabet  from ancient  Mon  and Khmer  scripts .
The Sukhothai kingdom  is credited  with producing  the most  sublime  religious  art  and sculpture  ever  seen  in Thailand , and for manufacturing  the most  perfect  pottery  and Buddha  images .
Sukhothai also  developed  the concept  of the Thai  town  – set  four  squares  on the plain  and protected  by triple  walls  and intervening  moats .
The Thai  pattern  was  so  successful  in terms of defence  (it allowed  more  walled  forts ) and flexibility  to match  the terrain  that it was  never  abandoned .
Ayutthaya’s art  and architecture  was  a delicate  blend  of Dvaravati, Khmer, Mon , Lawa and Khmer  cultures .
The city  site  at the heart  of the riverine system  of the lower  Chao Phrayabasin was carefully  chosen  to allow  a moated  trapezoid  plan  and a waterborne  way  of life .
Ayutthaya’s sister city  is Lop Buri, just  a short  distance  north 
It shared  in the capital  splendour .
One of Thailand ’s greatest  kings , Narai, built  a palace  there  that can still  be seen . It were  these two  glorious  cities  that Europeans  first  saw .
Ayutthaya’s  period , the golden_age  of Thai  culture  also  produced  the exquisite  architecture  and decoration  at Bang Pain, a royal  summer  palace  on the majestic  Chao Phraya River  just  south  of the capital , as well as the elegance  and grace  of Thai  classical  dance  and theatre .
All that remains  of 417  glorious  years  of Thai  cultures  are  the ruins  you can see  today . 
They are  now  a World  Heritage  site .
Historical  objects  and sites  are  a testimony  to every  country ’s civilization  and cultural  heritage .
 :104 : Historical  objects  and sites  serve  to bridge  the gap  between the past  and the present  and instill  in the people  a sense  of belonging  and pride  and the importance  of cherishing  their invaluable   legacy .
