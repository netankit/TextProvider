The most  populous  state  of India  with over 16 % the country  population , Uttar_Pradesh  is  the heartland  of India .
It stretches  from the towering  Himalayan  range  in_the_north , to the foothills  of the Terai and the Gangetic plains  down  to the east .
The Ganges_River , which forms  the backbone  of Uttar_Pradesh , is  the holy  river  of Hinduism  and there are  several  important  pilgrimage  towns  along it.
As per its topography , Uttar_Pradesh  can be  divided  into three  distinct  regions    the Himalayan  mountainous  region  in the north , the fertile  and vast  Gangetic plains  in the centre  and the rocky  Vindhya range  and plateau  to the south  of the state .
Many  important  rivers  originate  in the mountains  and flow  through the state ; they include  the mighty   Ganga , Yamuna, Ramganga, Gomti and Ghaghara.
Uttar_Pradesh  shares  international  boundaries  with Nepal  and China  and is surrounded  by the Indian  states  of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar .
Flora  & Fauna :  Subalpine  and alpine  forests  are found  in the upper  reaches  of the Himalayas .

A network  of rivers  runs  through the state , with a wide  variety  of fresh_water_fish  like mahaseer, hilsa, saul, rohu, mirgal, katla and trout .

The industrial  units , some  1700  of them in and around Agra , have been  in the  eye of a storm  in recent  times .
Conservationists  have realized  that industrial  and vehicular  pollution  caused  substantial  damage  to the monuments .
A Supreme_Court  order  banning  polluting  industries  evoked  strong  protest  from the local  entrepreneurs  but the process  of relocation  of industrial  units  and of creating  a 2  kms  exclusion zone  for petrol  and diesel  vehicles  around the  Taj  has begun .

You’ll most  likely  be asked  questions  about family  and home  not  because anybody wants  to pry  but because many  Indians  believe  that curiosity  conveys  concern .

Situated  on the banks  of the River  Yamuna, the 
Taj_Mahal  stands  at the northern  end  of formal  gardens .

The main  entrance  to the monument  is  of red  sandstone , with domed  pavilions  in the Hindu  style .

There are  fountains  and water  channels  flowing  through the garden , representing  the rivers  of water , milk , wine  and honey .
The monument  itself stands  on a raised  platform  with four  minarets  in the corners .

You have to remove  your shoes  before getting_on  to the platform ; socks  or cloth  shoes  available  at the base , should be kept_on  since the marble  gets  very  hot  during the day .
A huge  dome , rising  44  feet  high  with a brass  spire  on top , crowns  the Taj_Mahal .

The base  is  carved  with floral  motifs , of roses , tulips  and narcissi .
On both  sides  of the  Taj  are  two  identical  red  sandstone  mosques .
The one to the right , the Jawab (answer ) was built  only  for symmetry  and holds  no  prayers  since it faces  away  from Mecca .
In front of the main  entrance  is  a platform , which is  popular  for use  as a spot  for taking  photographs .
You will find  many  couples  sitting  on it with the Taj_Mahal  as the backdrop  to pose  for the most  precious  memento  of their visit .
