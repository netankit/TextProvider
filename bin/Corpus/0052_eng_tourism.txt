The average  lunchtime  will see  the streets  filled  with a seething  mass  of dark  suits ; the health  conscious  scurry  to find  a quick  bite  from one of the many  excellent  sandwich  bars , while the more  choleric  disappear  into one of the countless  dungeonesque wine_bars  or city  pubs  where daylight  is  an ugly  word  and a lunch  hour  can conclude  well  after sunset .

The former   docklands  area , made  redundant  by changes  in shipping  that have concentrated  on downriver  Tilbury, has rightly  been seen  as an opportunity  to revitalize  the area .
Crucial  to whatever  was done  was  the creation  of a decent  public_transport  system  and the result  is  the Docklands Light  Railway  with its speed , comfort  and good  value .
 Views  on the new   Docklands  in architectural  terms  may vary  but it is  beyond dispute  that an exciting  new  area  for living  and working  in  has been created .
The list  of shops  reads  right  across_the_board  with old established  names  like Austin Reed and Boots  rubbing frontages  with Gap Kids and Top Shop.

 London  has  the gift  for creating  cities  within a City , which is  why  it doesn't really  need  a mayor .
The new   Docklands  is  a fine  example  of this ability .
Nearest  Underground  Stations :  Canary Wharf and Canary Wharf DLR.

A slightly  scruffy  area  suffering  from an unsightly  flyover  cutting  right  through its centre , Hammersmith is  home  to the Apollo which hosts  many  top  class  acts  and popular  shows .
Just  to the south  of this the area  becomes more attractive : the delightful  Hammersmith Bridge  built  in the 1880 s links  the north  and south  banks  of the Thames  and has recently  been fully  restored .

Georgian  in character  and adorned  with 800  acres  of rolling  heath_land , Hampstead has always  been  a centre  for literary  activity  and the intelligentsia .
Hundreds  of small  shops , very  good  restaurants  and smashing  pubs  add  yet  more  allure .

Pronounced  'hoe bern', this area  is  home  to the distinctive  Inns of Court: historic  and beautiful  sets  of buildings  where barristers  have resided  since the 13 th  century .
A walk  through one of these Inns  is  often  like stepping  back  in time , especially  if you happen  upon a barrister  in his obligatory  eighteenth  century  court  attire .
The nature  and atmosphere  of these places  is summed_up  by the story  of a recent  visitor  who was walking  through the gas  lit  courtyards  on a dark  winter  night  when out of the mist  came  a  gaggle  of elderly  judges  in their full  bottomed  wigs .
