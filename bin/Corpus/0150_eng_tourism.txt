Brazil  origins   the Indians  with their reed  flutes , the Portuguese  with their singers  and viola  players , and the Africans  with their many  thrilling  rhythms   make  it a musical  country .
From the classical  compositions  of VillaLobos , to the soft  sounds  of  bossa nova  to the driving  beat  of samba , Brazil  has developed  music  of striking  sophistication , quality , and diversity .
When the Jesuit  fathers  first  arrived  in Brazil  they found  that the Indians  performed  ritual  songs  and dances  accompanied  by rudimentary  wind  and percussion_instruments .
The Jesuits  made_use_of  the music  to catechize  the Indians  by replacing  the original  words  with religious  ones using  the Tupi  language .
Music  accompanied  the sacramental  ceremonies  which were performed  in village  and church  plazas .
African  music  was introduced  during the colony  first  century  and was enriched  by its contact  with Iberian  music .
One of the most  important  type  of music  used  by the Negro  slaves  was  the comic  song   dance  called  lundu.
The second  half  of the 18 th  century  and during the 19 th  century , the sentimental  love_song  called  the modinha was  popular  and it was  sung  both in Brazil  salons  and at the Portuguese  Court .
Schools  of music  existed  in Bahia in the early  17 th  century  and religious  music  was played  in churches  throughout the colony .
As with other  art_forms , musical  activity  intensified  with the arrival  of the Royal_Family  in 1808 .
Local  musicians  also  attracted  the King  attention , such as José Nunes Garcia (1767 1830 ) who was  a notable   improvisor  on the organ  and clavichord .
João VI appointed  him Inspector  to the Royal  Chapel , a body  which had  more_than  100  instrumentalists  and singers , many of whom were  foreigners .
By the end  of the century , Carlos Gomes (1836 1896 ), born  in the town  of Campinas in the state  of São Paulo, produced  a number  of operas  in the prevailing  Italian  style , especially  Il Guarany, an opera  based  on a famous  Brazilian  novel  by José de Alencar about a colonial  villain  who incites  an Indian  attack  in order to gain  a Portuguese  nobleman  treasure  and his daughter  as a bride .
Brasílio Itiberê (1848 1913 ) was  the first  Brazilian  composer  to use  a popular  national  motif  in erudite  music .
Brazil  popular  music  developed  parallel  to its classical  music  and it also  united  traditional  European  instruments   guitar , piano , and flute   with a whole  rhythm  section  of sounds  produced  by frying_pans , small  barrels  with a membrane  and a stick  inside (cuícas) that make  wheezing  sounds , and tambourines .
In the mid  1960 's, the haunting , story  telling  lyric  of The Girl From Ipanema, carried  by a rich  melodic  line , was  the first  big  international  hit  to emerge  from the  bossa nova  movement  of Brazilian  singers  and composers .
At_first   bossa nova  was played  as an intimate  music  in the apartments  of Rio  middle  and upper  middle  classes .
Later_on   bossa nova  became  a trademark  of a new  concept  of music   a little  sad , sometimes  sung  offkey , and where the lyrics  have  great  importance .
Popular  regional  music  in Brazil  includes  the  Forró  from the northeast  where the accordion  and the flute  join  guitars  and percussion  in a foot stomping  country dance ; the  frevo , also  from the northeast , which has  an energetic , simple  style ; the  chorinho  (literally  little  tears ) from Rio  which combines  various  types  and sizes  of guitars , flutes ,  percussions , and an occasional  clarinet  or saxophone  in a tender  form  of instrumental  music ; and the internationally  successful  lambada.
When danced , lambada is  sensual  and fastpaced ; it got  its name  from the Portuguese  verb  to whip  or flog  referring  to the smacking  of thigh  against thigh .
Some  people  believe  that samba  was born  in the streets  of Rio_de_Janeiro  with contributions  from three  different  cultures   Portuguese  country  songs , African  rhythms , and native  Indian  fast  footwork .
Others believe  samba  is  simply  African  in origin  and that it evolved  from the  batuque , a music  based  on percussion_instruments  and 
hand  clapping .
Today  in Brazil , popular  music  continues  to explore  new  rhythms  and new  melodies .
Some of the wellknown  performers  are : Maria Bethania, Alcione, Roberto Carlos, Cazuza, Ney Matogrosso, Rita Lee, Milton Nascimento, Hermeto Pascoal, Fafá de Belém, Chitãozinho and Chororó, Elba Ramalho, Alceu Valença, Luiz Gonzaga, Luiz Gonzaga Jr., João Bosco, Djavan, Ivan Lins, Marisa Monte, and Elis Regina.
From the 16 th  century , Roman_Catholic  churches  and convents  in Brazil  were decorated  in the European  style , often  by Brazilian  craftsmen  who had been trained  in European  methods .
During the 17 th  and 18 th  centuries , baroque  and rococo  patterns  imported  from Portugal  dominated  Brazil  religious  architecture  and its interior  decor .
The most  impressive  artist  of the whole  colonial  period  was  the architect  and sculptor  Antônio Francisco Lisboa (1738 1814 ), better  known_as  Aleijadinho (the Little  Cripple ).
In mid life  Aleijadinho contracted  a crippling  disease , but he continued  to work  for another 30  years  with chisel  and mallet  strapped  to his wrists .
In the neighbouring  town  of Congonhas do Campo, at the Church  of Bom Jesus de Matosinhos, Aleijadinho sculpted  12  lifesized  soapstone  statues  of the Prophets  and placed  them on the terrace  and staircase  outside the entrance .
In front of the church  terraced  stairs , in six  small  devotional  chapels , he created  the Stations_of_the_Cross  with 66  poignant  statues  in cedar_wood .
During the last  four  decades  of the 18 th  century , new  art  appeared  (especially  in Rio_de_Janeiro ) in which religious  themes  were  no_longer  predominant .
Works  with temporal  themes , such as portraits  of exalted  personages , became  part  of Rio  artistic  production .
At the beginning  of the 19 th  century  there was  a process  of Europeanization  with the coming  of the Portuguese  Court  to Brazil  as the result  of the invasion  of Portugal  by Napoleon_Bonaparte  troops .
Dom João VI, the refugee  Portuguese  monarch , encouraged  Rio_de_Janeiro  intellectual  activity , founding  cultural  institutions  such as the Royal  Press  and the National  Library .
Artists  such as the Taunay brothers , architect  Auguste Grandjean de Montigny (1776 1850 ), and painter  JeanBaptiste Debret (1768 1848 ) were  part  of the group .
Debret, the most  important  of the French  artists , systematically  documented  landscapes , people , and rural  and urban  customs .
The tradition  established  by Debret and his colleagues  was  so  strong  that neoclassicism  and participation  in academies  ruled  Brazilian  visual  arts  well  into the Republican  era .
At the Week  of Modern  Art  held  in São Paulo in 1922 , artists  discussed  their dissatisfactions  with the academic  world  in all  fields  of the Brazilian  arts .
Although it is  not  clear  if the 1922  movement  caused  or coincided  with some  changes  in outlook  but it certainly  opened  broad  new  avenues  such as the critical  pursuit  of quality , the search  for new  values , and the rejection  of the old  European  stereotypes .
There was  no  precursor  of genius  in Brazilian  painting : in the 1920 's painting  simply  emerged  out of the shadows  of the academy  and joined  the wave  of innovation  then  sweeping  Europe .
The techniques  were imported , but the moods  and themes  were  clearly  Brazilian .
One of the most  important  participants  in the Week  of Modern  Art  was  Emiliano Di Cavalcanti (1897 1976 ), a true  Bohemian  from a family  of poets  and generals  who liked  to carouse  in the underworld  of Rio  and paint  seductive , mulatto  women .
Cândido Portinari (1903 1962 ) was  one of the first  Brazilian  artists  to paint  his way  to international  fame .
Portinari captured  in his canvases  the way  of life  of ordinary  people , conveying  their joys  and sufferings  in a dramatic  way .
The universality  of Portinari's work  led  to invitations  and commissions  from many  sources , among them the monumental  murals  at the Library  of Congress  in Washington_DC  and murals  on the theme  of war  and peace  at the United_Nations  in New_York .
World_War_II  brought_about  an interruption  in the contact  of Brazilian  artists  with the international  art  world , even though many  foreign  artists  lived  in Brazil .
In the late  1940 's the Modern Art Museum  was founded  in Rio_de_Janeiro  and São Paulo got  two  museums   the Art Museum  of São Paulo founded  by Assis Chateaubriand and the Museum  of Modern Art.
The São Paulo Biennial, founded  in 1951  by Francisco Matarazzo Sobrinho, helped  to call Brazilian  artists  to the attention of an international  audience , and to introduce  foreign  artistic  innovations  to Brazil .
Brazil  painters , sculptors , engravers  and lithographers  show  their works  both within  Brazil  and in museums  and galleries  throughout the world .
The Portuguese  who first  landed  on Brazilian  soil  in the 16 th  century  began  the transplantation  of European  culture  to Brazil . 
While the Portuguese  were  still  forming  small , cautious  groups  to explore  the unknown  beaches , native  Indian  potters  were  at work.
Musicians  and dancers  decked_out  in fibre  masks , plaited  straw , and fantastic , feather  helmets  were retelling  the legends  of the Flood  and the Creation .
Brazilian  Culture  is  more_than  the simple  result  of specific  contributions  by Europeans , Africans  and Indians .
Brazilian  folk_arts  are  among the richest  and most  varied  in the hemisphere .
Brazilian  folk_dance  and folk  drama  are  rich  forms  of popular  artistic  expression .
Subject , rhythm , costume , and choreography  reveal  the three  principal  components  of the nation  culture  in a complex  interaction .
There are  dozens  of Brazilian  folk_dances   everything from dramatizations  of the early  wars  between the Portuguese  and the Indians  (Caboclinhos and Caiapós performed  in the states  of Pernambuco  and Alagoas), to the Cavalhada of Pirenópolis in the state  of Goiás, a theatrical  pageant , lasting  three  days , which depicts  the fight  between the Christians  and the Moors  on the Iberian_Peninsula .
 :94 :In addition to the folk_dances , there are  many  dance  dramas  (really  theatrical  productions ) popular  in Brazil  that trace  their histories  directly  to the Middle_Ages .
Portuguese  in origin , these dance  dramas  have been modified  considerably  by centuries  of exposure  to Brazil  diverse  cultures .
Mario de Andrade, the great  authority  on national  folklore , has classified  these dance  dramas  into four  principal  groups : reisados, cheganças, pastoris, and ranchos.
The Reisados consist_of  a series  of 24  
folk  plays  of which the most  popular  is  the BumbaMeuBoi.
The plot  of the Boi drama  centers_around  the misfortunes  of the prize  bull  which a wealthy  cattle  rancher  has arduously  searched  for to improve  his herd .
Cheganças (arrival ) is  a folk  play  performed  during the Christmas  season  it tells  of the arrival  by sea  of the Moors , their defeat , and their eventual  baptism  by the Christians .
Pastoris (shepherds ) started  as a performance  of Christmas_carols  in front of the Nativity  scene  in preparation  for midnight  mass .
Female  street  revelers  parade  in parallel  lines  called  the red  and blue  lines  and each  line  has  the same  characters ,  the teacher , Diana, the pretty  angel , the gypsy , the old  man  (a comedian ),  the Northern  Star ,  and the Southern  Cross , among others.
Among the most  primitive  forms  of carnival , as celebrated  in Rio_de_Janeiro , were  the ranchos, solemn  and romantic  love_stories  acted_out  by dancers  to the beat  of a marching  rhythm .
New  ranchos were written  every  year  and groups  of dancers  representing  various  districts  of Rio  performed  them.
