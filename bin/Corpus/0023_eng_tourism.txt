Kolhapur, I have heard , does not  have much  to offer  a tourist .
Some  interesting  architecture ; all  designed  by a chap  named  Charles Mant, who a Kolhapur maharaja hired  in the late  nineteenth  century  to change  the look  of the city .
A peculiar  person , Mant committed  suicide  after  constructing  some  two  dozen  masterpieces  because he was  terrified  that one  of buildings  would collapse .

An occasional  buffalo , with unusually  long  curved  horns  clipclops along  the road  at a rapid  pace , even  as its owner  huffs  and puffs  behind , desperately  attempting  to keep_up .
Jyotiba temple  is  around 15  kilometers  away from the city .
As the auto rickshaw wound  its way  up  the steep  mountain , pretty  ashtambar trees  and mango  orchards  come  into view .

The entire  coastline  of the_western  state  of Maharashtra   starting  from the well_known  town s of Kihim and Alibag in the north  to the town  of Vengurla in the south  where it merges  with that of Goa.
