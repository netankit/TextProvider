Almost  500  years  on, the impact  of Spanish  conquistadores  can be seen  in the tall , ornate  churches  that crown  the hillsides  and plazas  of Mexico  cities  and whitewashed  walls  of haciendas .
But traces  of earlier  inhabitants  remain  in the remarkable  temples  and pyramids  at Palenque and Teotihuacán, and in the traditions  of dozens  of indigenous  cultures .
Accompanying  it all  are  the subtle  spices  of Mexico  famous  tortillas , tamales  and enchiladas , washed_down  with bold  red_wines  and heady  tequila  and mescal .
Mexico  earliest  known  civilization  was  the Holmic in the second  century  BC , a Mayan  culture  advanced  in religion , architecture  and mathematics , who reached  their height  between AD  600 900 .

The Aztec  Empire  controlled  vast  territories  from the Yucatán peninsula  to the Pacific , with over 370  individual  nations  under their authority .
Ruling  from their capital  city , Tenochtitlan, the Aztecs  demanded  heavy  tribute  from their subjects , which caused  some to side  with Cortés.
The other  factor  on Cortés' side  was  the lucky  coincidence  that 1519  was  the exact  year  when legend  had it that the Aztec  god , Quetzalcoatl , would return  from the east  and so Cortés was mistaken  for a god .
After two  years  of fighting , the Aztecs  were defeated .
Mexico  later  achieved  independence  after the wars  of 1810 21 .
In Mexico_City  is  the Plaza  de las Tres Culturas, which celebrates the three  major  cultures  that have shaped  Mexico : there are  Aztec  ruins , the 17 th century  colonial  church  of San Diego and several  late  20 th century  buildings .

Sierra Madre mountains , volcanoes , national_parks  and beaches .
History  comes_to_life  in Mexico : the scars  of recent  history  are  still  apparent .
