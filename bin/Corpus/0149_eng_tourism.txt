Religion  has long  played  an important  role  in the culture  and lives  of the people  of Russia .
In Russia  religion  has influenced  government , created  holidays  and given  people  hope  for better  things  during the most  desperate  times .
Russia  became  a Christian  country  in 988  when Prince  Vladimir of Kiev  adopted  the new  religion ; this historical  event  laid  the foundation  for the Russian_Orthodox_Church  which is  still  the religious  denomination  in the country .
When Communism  gripped  the country  and a new  period  of religious  intolerance  was begun  as  many  as seventy  years  the official  religion  of the country  remained  ‘atheism ’.
Freedom  of religion  is  something  practised  in most  Russian  cities  and many of the beautiful  churches  that were  once  abandoned  have again  become  filled  with parishioners .
Many  old  churches , monasteries  and cathedrals  have managed  to survive  Communism  and today  they make  fascinating  tourist  attractions  in addition to  still  being  houses_of_worship .
Places  such as the Andronikov Monastery , the Cathedral  of the Archangel , the St. Sophia Cathedral  in Novgorod  or the Monastery  of the Transfiguration  on Valaam Island are  all  fantastic  tourist  stops .
You do not  have to be  a member  of a particular  faith  to appreciate  the lavish  decorations , the ornate  fixtures  and the beautiful  and skilful  designs  of many of the churches  and monasteries  of Russia .

Russia  is  a land  of white  snow  and lethal  winters , but also  of rivers  that ramble  across the meadows  and a midsummer  sun  that never  sets .
When it comes_to  getting  back  to nature , you can choose  from several  natural  zones  such as arctic , snow  laden  deserts  to millennia  old  forests  in North_West  Russia .

It took  many  years  for Russia  to grow  and develop  as a country .
Eventually , under the rule  of Peter the 1 st, the conquered  land_mass  was extended  to the Baltic_Sea  and the whole  territory  was renamed  the Russian  Empire .
Communism  took  a hold  of the country , many  lives  were lost  and the economy  slowly  fell  into a decline .
In December  1991 , the USSR  was splintered  into fifteen  independent  republics  and it has since struggled  to build  a good  democratic  political system .
Russia  is starting  to regain  economic  momentum  and many of the scars  left  by communism  are slowly  disappearing  but unfortunately , there is  still  guerrilla  conflict  in Chechnya .
Russia  is  an incredibly  large  country  and it expands  over much of Eurasia .
Much of Northern  Asia  and some of Western  Europe  are  part  of Russia  and it is bordered  by the Arctic_Ocean  and the North_Pacific  Ocean .
The geographical  area  that makes_up  Russia_spans  17  075  200   square kilometers . 
Of this, 16  995  800   square kilometers  is  land  and 79  400   square kilometers  is  water .
Generally_speaking , the winters  vary  from cool  to frigid  while the summers  range  from humid  to cool .
Terrain  in Russia  is  vivid : there are  the coniferous  forest  of the  taiga  and wooded  areas , the cold  bleak  tundra  in Northern  Siberia , the broad  plains  and low  hills  west  of the Urals , and the uplands  and mountains  which lie  along the Southern  border  regions .
The lowest  point  of Russia  is  the Caspian_Sea  which lies  at an elevation  of 28  meters  and the highest  is  
Mount  Elbrus (also  the highest  mountain  in Europe ) which towers  upto 5633  meters .
Russia  has  an incredible  wealth  of natural_resources , many of which it is  well_known  for.
However , because of the vastness  of the landscape , much of the lands  natural_resources_  are yet  to be discovered .
The majority  of people  in Russia  is  Russian_Orthodox , while there is  a minority  of Muslim  adherents  in the country .
The main  language  in the country  is  Russian  but there are  a lot  of other  minority  languages  which are spoken  in different  regions .
Facilities  for Telephones , cellular_phones , radio  and television  stations  have been firmly  established  in the country  for some  time  now , the internet  is  also  readily  available  and is used  by a large  portion  of the country  inhabitants .
Russian  Music  incorporates  numerous  genres  including  folk_music , opera , classical  and contemporary , such as rock , pop  
and_so_forth .
It has been said  that Russian  music  composers  are conveying  a story  to their listeners , telling  of the joys , pain , pleasure  and suffering  of people .
Russia  borders  encompass  a diversity  of ethnic  groups  each  possessing  their own  culture  and along with that its own  form  of folk_music .
Whilst the country  was  under Soviet  rule , all  music  was to remain  within certain  limits  and was carefully  scrutinized .
However  when the USSR  dissolved  westernized  music  in the form  of pop  and rock  became  popular  in Russia .
Among Russia  greatest  classical  composers  were  individuals  such as Sergei_Prokofiev , Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky , Mikhail_Glinka , Sergei_Rachmaninoff  and_Igor_Stravinsky .
The Soviet  era  saw  restrictions , but still  many  new  singers , bands  and composers  arose  and today , Russia  produces  a variety  of modern  music  genres  including  rock , metal, electronic, alternative and  ska punk.
Russian  music , particularly  folk_music , features  a number  of traditional  instruments

Brazil  begins  to show  its more  urban  side  in the Southeast . 
The states  of Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio_de_Janeiro_ and São Paulo, comprise  this region .
In Rio_de_Janeiro , known_as  the "cidade maravilhosa" (marvelous  city ), the lush  greenery  is  starkly  contrasted  against the thousands  of modern  buildings  within this bustling  metropolis .

In the city  of São Paulo, the largest  metropolis  in South_America , all  the continents  intermingle  within the most  modern , cosmopolitan , and urban  of settings .
The inhabitants  of São Paulo are  mainly  of European , Japanese , and Arab  ancestry .
Together , they built  veritable  industrial  and commercial  empires , bringing  with them their native  culture  and cuisine .
The northern  coast  of the state  of São Paulo boasts  splendid  beaches  at Ilha bela, Ubatuba, and São Sebastião.
In the 15 th  and 16 th  centuries  Portugal , an Iberian  Kingdom  with barely  a million  inhabitants , was hemmed_in  by the Atlantic  in_front  and by a hostile  Castile  behind .
After years  of struggle  against the Moorish  occupation , the Portuguese  turned  their attention  and energy  to the sea  and what lay  beyond .
While the Spaniards  set_out  in search  of a route  to the Orient  by voyaging  to the West , the Portuguese  opted  for the socalled   Southern Cycle  down the African  coast .
For a small  nation , secrecy  was  the only  available  method  of safeguarding  the rewards  of bold  and successful  exploration  against exploitation  by more  powerful  maritime  rivals .
Portuguese  knew  of the existence  of lands  across the Atlantic  and they had made  several  expeditions  to the West  before  Columbus  discovered  the Antilles  in 1492 , but they had kept  the knowledge  to themselves in order to forestall  the ambitions  of Spain , England , and France .
Reaching  the Cape_of_Good_Hope  in 1487 , Portuguese  were  led  by the navigator , Vasco da Gama, across the Indian_Ocean  to discover  the sea  route  to the Far_East  in 1497 .
The Treaty  of Tordesillas (1494 ) settled  the question  of possession  of the new  lands  between Spain  and Portugal.
It was agreed  that territories  lying  east  of a meridian  370  leagues  west  of the Cape_Verde_Islands  should belong  to Portugal , the lands  to the west  to Spain .
An imaginary  line  (mentioned  in treaty ), from pole  to pole , cut_through  the easternmost  part  of the South_American  continent  and constituted  Brazil  first  frontier , although the formal  discovery  by Pedro Alvares Cabral did not  take_place  until six  years  later  in 1500 .
The most   exploitable  wealth  that the Portuguese  found  was a wood  that produced  red  and purple  dyes , paubrasil (from which the country  derived  its name ).
Organized  occupation  only  began  in 1530 , when Portugal  sent_out  the first  colonists  with domestic_animals , plants , and seeds  to establish  permanent  settlements .
São Vicente on the coast  of the modern  State  of São Paulo was  founded  in 1532 , and the city  of Salvador, later  chosen  as the seat  of the Governor_General , followed  in 1549 .
As a first  step  to establish  the administration  system , the Portuguese  Crown  created  a number  of hereditary  fiefs , or captaincies .
Fourteen  captaincies  some larger  than Portugal  itself were  established  in the mid  16 th  century , and the beneficiaries , called  donatários, were  responsible  for their defense  and development .
The moist  and fertile  seaboard  of what is  now  the State  of Pernambuco  was  very  suitable  for growing   sugar  and also  conveniently  located  as a port_of_call  for sailing_ships  traveling  from Portugal  to West_Africa  and the Orient .
A flourishing  triangular  trade  soon  developed , based  on the importation  of slave  labor  from West_Africa  to work  on  sugar  plantations .
Paradoxically , Portugal  60  years  of union  with Spain  were  to confer  unexpected  advantages  on her transatlantic  colony .
In the absence  of boundaries , both  the Portuguese  and the Brazilians  started  penetrating  deeper  into the vast  hinterlands .
Expeditions  (known_as  Bandeiras) in search  of Indian  slaves  cut  their way  through forest , climbed  the difficult  escarpments , and marched  across the inland  plateau .
In 1640 , when the Portuguese  under John VI recovered  their Independence , they refused  to abandon  the lands  they had occupied  and colonized  west  of the original  Tordesillas line .
Claiming  what has  since become  recognized  in international_law  as the right  of uti possidetis, the right  derived  not_only  from title  but also from useful  possession , the Portuguese  succeeded  in establishing  themselves as the rightful  owners .
The second  half  of the 17 th  century  saw  Portugal  freed  from Spanish  rule , the northeast  of Brazil  liberated  from a 24 year  occupation  by Dutch  forces , and the weakening  of Brazil  sugar  economy .
While the gold_rush  which followed  drained  
thousands  of people  away  from the coastal  plantations , it also  attracted  fresh  immigration  from Portugal .
Altogether  nearly  1 ,000  tons  of gold  and 3  million  carats  of diamonds  were taken  from the region  between  1700  and l800 .
The growth  of gold  mining  in Brazil  was  an important  development  which influenced  the course  of events  not_only  in the colony  but also in Europe .
But the boom  in gold  and diamond  mining , like that of sugar , was  destined  to be followed  by the rise  of an even  more  important  source  of wealth , coffee .
Just  as mining  caused  a migration  of people  from Pernambuco  and Bahia southwards  to Minas Gerais, so the spread  of coffee  growing  advanced  the settlement  of empty  land  still  further  to the south .
The early  plantations  of Coffee  were  in regions  in the hinterland  of Rio_de_Janeiro  well  provided  with slave  labor ; but the abolition  of slavery  and European  immigration  into the State  of São Paulo in the late  19 th  century  caused  coffee  growing  to move  southwards  to the region  where soil  conditions , climate , and altitude  combined  to create  an ideal  environment .
Another  important  event  in the second  half  of the 18 th  century  was  the transfer  of the seat  of colonial  government .
After more_than  200  years  in Salvador, the capital  was moved  to Rio_de_Janeiro , where it dominated  the main  access  route  to Minas Gerais and was  closer  to the growing  population  centers  in the southern  regions  of the colony .
Monopolizing  all  trade  with Brazil , Portugal  retained  a substantial  part  of the profits , and this led  to growing  discontent  among the settlers .
For those of you who do not  understand  Spanish  or Portuguese , the word  Bonito translates  in English  to beautiful .
However , many  believe  that this destination  was  not  named  justifiably  as Bonito simply  does not  describe  the extraordinariness  of the attractions ! Merely  a decade  ago , this region  remained  undiscovered  by tourists .
There are  daily  flights  from Rio_de_Janeiro  and São Paulo to Campo Grande. 
Bonito is  175  miles  from Campo Grande, (approximately  3  hours  by car  due_to  road  conditions ).
All  tours  throughout the region  are led  by excellently  trained  guides  and, although most  caves  and grottos  could hold  as  many  as 100  people , are  kept  to a maximum  of 15  people .
Warm  canals  meander  through the dunes , creating  an abundance  of small  islands , 83  to be  exact , and a rich  selection  of ecosystems , including  forests , beaches , mangroves , lagoons  and dunes .
Exploring  this region  can be done  by foot , horseback , or various  boats , such as canoes , kayaks , and  gaiolas , boats  typically  used  by  locals , both here  and in the Amazon .
