Two of the best  trains  viz.  Shatabdi Express  (between Delhi  and Bhopal) and Taj Express  (between Delhi  and Gwalior) are  available  to access  Agra .
Agra , on crossroads  of national  highways  2 , 3  and 11 , is  excellently  connected  to all  parts  of the country .
Kheria Airport  (Airport  of Agra ) is  about  6  km  from the Agra  city_centre  and is  easily  accessible  by taxis  and  auto rickshaws  at nominal  rates .
Agra  is  well  connected  by excellent  train  services  to Delhi  such as The Shatabdi Express  (2  hrs ), Taj Express  (2 .5  hrs ), Intercity Express  (3  hrs ).
Agra  is  one of the prominent  destinations  of the World  Tourism  map  with three  heritage  monuments , Taj_Mahal , Red  Fort  & Fatehpur Sikri.
Agra  is  more_than  just  a decadent  city  of graveyards  and stones , but it is  a vibrant  centre  of Culture , Art  and Religious  philosophies  that have enriched  mankind  and shaped  human  thought  over centuries .
Agra  is  situated  in the State  of Uttar_Pradesh , India .
Agra  is  famous  as being  home  to one of the Seven  Wonders  of the World , the Taj_Mahal .
The architectural  splendor  of the mausoleums , the fort  and the palaces  is  a vivid  reminder  of the capital  in the 16 th  and early  17 th  centuries .
While Agra  significance  as a political  centre  ended  with the transfer  of the capital  to Delhi  in 1634  by Shah_Jahan , its architectural  wealth  has secured  its place  on the international  map .
A pleasant  town  with comparatively  slow  pace , Agra  is  known  for its superb  inlay  work  on marble  and soapstone  by craftsman  who is  a descendant  of those who worked  under the Moghuls .
Agra  was  once  the capital  of the Moghul  empire  and even  today  it seems  to linger  in the past .
Not  surprising , for the Moghul  emperors  with their passion  for building , endowed  the city  with some of the finest  structures  in the world .
It is  very  easy  to slip_away  here  through the centuries  into the grandeur  and intrigues  of the  Moghul  court .
Agra  is  an old  city  and it is said  that its name  was derived  from Agrabana, a forest  that finds  mention  in the epic  Mahabharata .
In more  recent  times  Agra  came  into prominence  when Sikandar Lodi made  it his capital  city  in 1501 .
The Lodi rule  was  to end  very  soon  and Agra  passed  into the possession  of the Moghuls .
It was  during the time  of the third  emperor  Akbar that Agra   came into its own .
Akbar embarked  on the construction  of the massive  Agra  Fort  in 1565 .
Agra  continued  to retain  its importance  and Shah_Jehan , Akbar's grandson  ornamented  the city  with that masterpiece  of  Moghul  architecture  the Taj_Mahal  and built  several  other  beautiful  buildings  within the Agra  fort  .
Inside the Taj_Mahal  the  Cenotaph  of Mumtaz Mahal stands  in the centre  of the marble  screen .
It has inscribed  on it in Persian  with texts  from the Koran .
Above the tombs  is  a Cairene  lamp , the flame  of which is  supposed  to never  burn_out .
The interior  of the mausoleum  comprises  a lofty  central  chamber , a crypt  immediately  below this and four  octagonal  corner  rooms  originally  intended  to house  the graves  of other  royal_family  members .
In the centre  of the Taj_Mahal  there are  the  cenotaphs  of Shah_Jahan  and Mumtaz Mahal.
Shah_Jahan   cenotaph  is  to the left  and is  higher  than that of his beloved  which rests  immediately  below the dome .
The acoustics of the building  are  superb  with the domed  ceiling  being designed  to echo  chants  from Koran  and melodies .
It is suggested  that one walk  around the outside  of the tomb , before retrieving  your shoes , to appreciate  it from all  sides .
Taj_Mahal : Location : In the mid 16 th  and earlier 17 th  centuries , Agra  witnessed  a frenzied  building  activity  and it was  during this time  that the symbol  of love , the Taj_Mahal , was built .
The buildings  made  during mid 16 th  and earlier 17 th  centuries  were  purely  in the contemporary  Mughal style  and of very  high  quality .

Agra , the city  of the Taj_Mahal  and once  the capital  of the Moghul  Empire , has several  monuments  which display  the splendour  of Mughal architecture .
It was  Agra  that Babur, the founder  of the dynasty , had the first  formal  Persian  garden  laid_out  on the banks  of the river  Yamuna.
Akbar, his grandson , raised  the towering  ramparts  of the great  Red  Fort , within whose walls  Jahangir built  rose_red  palaces , courts  and gardens , and which Shah_Jahan  embellished  with marble  mosques , palaces  and pavilions  of gem  inlaid  white  marble .
Agra  is mentioned  in the ancient  epic  Mahabharata  as Agraban, the  sister  city  of the more  prominent  Mathura.
Agra  was established  in 1475  by Badal Singh and  came into its own  when Sikander Lodhi of the Lodhi dynasty  chose  it for his capital  because of its proximity  to the Yamuna.
Babar defeated  the Lodhis to capture  not_only  Agra  but also  to lay  the foundation  of the Moghul  Empire .
On the banks  of river  Yamuna, rises  the crescent  like  Agra Fort .
Designed  and built  by Emperor  Akbar in 1565  A_.D.  the fort  is surrounded  by a 70  foot  high  wall .
Agra Fort  houses  the beautiful  Pearl  Mosque  and numerous  palaces  including  the Jahangiri Mahal, Khas Mahal, DiwaniKhas, DiwaniAm, Machihi Bhawan and Moti Masjid .
The Agra Fort  has  four  gates  and is enclosed  by a double  battlemented  wall  of red  sand_stone .
Mosques  of Taj_Mahal  on either side  of the Taj_Mahal  are  buildings  of red  sandstone .
Before  we have  a look  at the mosque , let us take_note  of a small  stone  enclosure  along the western  boundary  wall  where the well  of the Mosque  is located .
This greenery  shaded  structure , measuring  19  ft  by 6 .5  ft  marks  the site  where the remains  of Mumtaz Mahal were deposited  when first  brought  to Agra .
The platform  in front of the Mosque  is  of red  sandstone .
A highly  polished  small  marble  piece  is  so fitted  that it serves  as a mirror  and one can see  the mausoleum  reflected  in it.
The roof  of the Mosque  supports  four  octagonal  towers  and three  elegant  domes .

The story  of Taj_Mahal  is  inseparable  from the life  of Mumtaz who was  the chief  queen  of Shah_Jahan .
Prince  Khurram, as Shah_Jahan  was  known  before  he became  the Moghul  emperor , was  a handsome  twenty  year  old  man , when he was betrothed  to Mumtaz.
It is said  that the imperial  capital  of Agra  was  agog  with the description  of Mumtazâ€™s beauty  at the time  of the betrothal .
The maiden_name  of Mumtaz Mahal was  Arjumand Banu Begum. Prince  Khurram had been married  twice  before  he met  and married  Mumtaz Mahal.
It is said  that Mumtaz Mahal on her deathbed  had herself asked  her husband  to create  a symbol  of their love  for posterity .
Before the construction  of Taj_Mahal  began , Mumtaz Mahal was given  a temporary  burial  in the Zainabadi garden  in Burhanpur for a period  of six  months , before the body  was exhumed  and brought  to Agra , for the final  burial .
Taj_Mahal  is  a monument  of love .
 Taj  is  the  pride  of India .
The story  behind Taj_Mahal  is  also  as  beautiful  as the monument .
Arjumand Banu a shopkeeper  was sitting  at her shop  in Meena Bazar , the private  market  attached  to the harem , when Prince  Khurram saw  her for the first  time .
Khurram saw  a piece  of glass  at Arjumand Banu's shop  and asked  for its  worth . 
She replied  that it is  a diamond  and not  glass .
 :62 : Emperor  Jahangir entitled  Prince  Khurram as 'Shah_Jahan ' and when he became  emperor  he entitled  his wife  as Mumtaz Mahal 'the chosen  one  of the palace '.
Mumtaz was  very  compassionate , generous  and demure .
Before dying  Mumtaz extracted  a promise  from Shah_Jahan  that after her death  he would build  the most  beautiful  building  of the world  as a tribute  to their love .
Sikandra Fort  is  the mausoleum  of emperor  Akbar represent  his philosophy  and  secular  outlook , combining  the best of Hindu  and Muslim  architectures  in a superlative  region .
Completed  in 1613  A_.D.  by his son  Jahangir, Sikandra Fort  is  one of the well  preserved  monuments .
Sikandra Fort  is  the last  resting  place  of the Moghul  Emperor  Akbar.
A visit  to Akbar's monument  opens  before one, the completeness  of Akbar's personality  as  completely  as the Taj_Mahal  does  of Mumtaz Mahal's.
Akbar's vast , beautifully  carved  red  ochre  sandstone  tomb  is  set  amidst a lush  garden .
To construct  a tomb  in one's lifetime  was  a Tartary custom  which the Moghuls  followed  religiously .
Built  of red  sandstone , the minarets  are  inlaid  with white  marble  polygonal  patterns ; the pleasing  proportions  & profuse  surface  ornamentation  makes  the gateways  very  impressive .
The gateways  reflect  a curious  hybrid  of different  styles  of architecture  Hindu , Muslim , Christian  and a patent  mixture  of Akbar's typical  style .
A broad  paved  causeway  lead  to the tomb , which has  five  storeys  and is  in the shape  of a truncated  pyramid .
The main  tomb  has  a unique  square  design  which is  unparalleled  by all  other   Moghul  buildings .
The centre  of the southern  side  is occupied  by a vestibule , which has been ornamented  very  profusely  with exquisite  carvings , artistic  paintings  & inlay  work  in geometric  and floral  designs .
The tombstone  of Akbar is placed  in the centre  of the room . 
Geometrical  designs  achieved  by the mosaics  of glazed  tiles  or of colored  stones , predominate  the tomb .
 :77 : The use  of an ornamental  arch  and square  pillar  has brought_about  a unique  composition .
The fifth  storey  is  entirely  in white  marble  as against the lower  storey  which is finished  in red  sandstone .
False  gateways , which may be  appropriately  called  water  pavilions , have been constructed  in the centre  of the north  and south  sides .
The shallow  water  channels , which originally  took  water  from two  overhead  tanks  situated  on the riverside , run  on all  sides  of the garden  and around the mausoleum  pictures  of Taj_Mahal .
The story  of Taj_Mahal  reflects  the intensity  of love .
Akbar invited  the architects  and artisans  from all_over  the world  and planned  for the building  with absolute  perfection .
Taj_Mahal  was structured  in Persian  style  combined  with carvings  of artisans  called  from Afghanistan  and the garden  designers  from  Kashmir .
The carvings  of Taj_Mahal  were decorated  with very  precious  gemstones .
Taj_Mahal  is  an evidence  that how the emotions  and feelings  are  important  to human  life .
The story  of the Taj_Mahal  is  an example  of devotion  and faith .
The story  of the Taj_Mahal  is  a love_story  not  found  in papers  but stands  in the structural  form .
The ceiling  of the verandah  is painted  with trees , birds , beast  and geometric  design .
The doorway  shows  a row  of eight  Buddhas  surrounded  by female  guardians , river gooses, and  scrollwork  and lotus  petals .
One of the most  perfectly  executed  rock  cut  Chaityas with elaborately  carved  interiors .
On the left  wall  is  a fragment  of a painting  showing  the Buddha  preaching  to the congregation .
Above the side  shrines  of the verandah  are  carved  Hariti, the goddess  of prosperity , and her attendants  to the right , and a court  of Naga, the serpent  king  to the left . 
Excavated  at a higher  level , this small  monastery  with a narrow  verandah  has  four  unfinished  cells .
 :94 : On the right  wall  of the shrine  are painted  the seven  Manushi Buddhas with Maitreya , under their respective  Bodhi Trees .
The interior  of this Chaityas Hall  is decorated  with carved  Buddha  figures .
The focal  Stupa  has  an image  of the Master seated  in a pavilion .
The two  narrative  scenes  on the left  wall  show  the temptation  by Mara, the god  of passion , and a colossal  carved  figure  of the reclining  Buddha , depicting  his ultimate  salvation  from the cycle  of rebirth , the Mahaparinirvana.
The ancient  artists  of Ajanta covered  the rough  walls  with a layer  of mud  and cow_dung , mixed  with straw  or animal  hair  as a binding  medium .
The paintings  in the Ajanta caves  are often  mistakenly  referred  to as frescoes .
A fresco  refers  to the application  of colors  to moist  lime  plaster .
At Ajanta, the paintings  were done  on dry  wall .
According  to an ingenious  theory , the depression  in the floor  of the main  chambers , a feature  of all  caves , was filled  with water , which caught  the few  rays  that did reach  into the darkness .
Another  amazing  fact  about the paintings  of Ajanta is  that they were done  in extremely  poor  light  in the caves .
