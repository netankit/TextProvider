 Sitting  on the western  bank  of the River  Yamuna, Agra  is  just  over 200  kms  from Delhi .
The Hindu  epic  Mahabharata  refers  to it as ‘Agraban’, part  of Brij Bhoomi, the homeland  of  Lord  Krishna .
The earliest  recorded  history  of Agra , however , is  its establishment  by a local  king  in 1475 .
It grew  into an important  power centre  under the Delhi  Sultan Sikandar Lodi, who shifted  his capital  from Delhi  in 1504 .
Agra  attained  full  glory  in the Moghul  period , from the time  Babur captured  it in 1526 .
Babur’s son , Emperor  Akbar, who was  a great  empire  builder  commissioned the Agra  Fort  in 1565  and the city  grew  around the nucleus  of the fort .
However , Agra  is  best known  for the Taj_Mahal , one of the Seven  Wonders  of the modern  World . 
Emperor  Shah_Jahan  built  this exquisite  white  marble  mausoleum  for his favorite  queen  Mumtaz Mahal.
 :8 : Declared  a World  Heritage  Site  by the UNESCO , the Taj_Mahal  has always  evoked  varying  emotions  from wonder  to ecstasy  and often_times,  inspired  poetic  verse .
Over the centuries , it has become  the symbol  of undying  love  and flawless  beauty .
The monument  was commissioned in 1631  and took  20 ,000  artisans , 22  years  to complete .
An entire  township  now  known_as  Taj Ganj came_up  around the site .
Here , craftsmen  live  and sell  their wares  of marble  and stone  inlay  and replicas  of the  Taj .
After the reign  of the last  great  Moghul , Aurangzeb, Agra  fell  into the hands  of the Jats  and then  the Marathas .
In 1803 , the British  under General  Lake captured  the city .
Once_again , it secured  its position  of eminence  as the capital  of the northwestern  provinces .
After the Sepoy_Mutiny  of 1857 , the capital  of the Central  Province  and its High  Court  were moved  to Allahabad.
From the rule  of the Jats  to the early  British  period , Agra  monuments  were plundered  and exquisitely  crafted  pieces  transported  away .
The city  fell  into decline  and disarray  till modern  times , when people  rediscovered  its historical  importance  and tremendous  tourist  potential .
Emperor  Shah_Jahan  built  this white  marble  mausoleum  for his queen  Arjumand Bano Begum or Mumtaz Mahal.
The building  aside , the Taj_Mahal  is  one of the most  glorious  symbols  of love .
Great  builder  that he was , the Emperor  commissioned  a building  that has lasted  centuries  to remain  a thing  of rare  breathtaking  beauty .
The building  was commissioned in 1631  and decorated  with the landmark  technique  of intricate  marble  inlay  work .
Situated  on the banks  of the River  Yamuna, the Taj_Mahal  stands  at the northern  end  of formal  gardens .
The white  marble  came  from Makrana in Rajasthan and the red  sandstone  from Fatehpur Sikri.
Precious  stones  like jade , crystal , turquoise , lapis_lazuli , sapphire , jade , coral  and diamonds  were brought  from farflung  places  in Tibet , China , Sri_Lanka , Persia  and Afghanistan .
It is believed  that a  fleet  of 1000  elephants  was used  to transport  the material .
The main  entrance  to the monument  is  of red  sandstone , with domed  pavilions  in the Hindu  style . 
The gateway  is inscribed  with verses  from the Koran , the lettering  of which appear  the same  size  through an illusion  created  by the craftsmen  who enlarged  and lengthened  the letters  at different  positions .
 :28 : The gardens  enclosed  by high  walls  are divided  into four  parts  or the Charbagh, which symbolizes  the Gardens  of Paradise  in Islam .
There are  fountains  and water  channels  flowing  through the garden , representing  the rivers  of water , milk , wine  and honey .
The monument  itself stands  on a raised  platform  with four  minarets  in the corners .
The minarets  have  a slightly  outward incline , to prevent  them from falling  on the monument  during an earthquake .
You have to remove  your shoes  before getting_on  to the platform . 
Socks , or cloth  shoes  available  at the base , should be kept  on  since the marble  gets  very  hot  during the day .
A huge  dome , rising  44  feet  high  with a brass  spire  on top  crowns  the Taj_Mahal .
Inside  is  a central  chamber  with high  ceilings  that houses  the  cenotaphs  of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah_Jahan .
A delicately  carved  trellis  work  marble  screen  encloses  them.
The empress ’ tomb , which is  directly  under the dome , has  the 99  names  of Allah  inscribed  on it. 
Shah_Jahan ’s  cenotaph  is  higher  and to the left . 
It has  a pen  box  inscribed  on it, which symbolizes  a male  ruler .
 :38 : Just  below these  cenotaphs  are  the real  graves , in a dark  and humid  crypt  filled  with incense .
 :39 : If you donate  a few  coins  to the attendant , he will lay  them as offerings  on the graves .
Surrounding  the central  chamber  are  four  octagonal  rooms  where the other  members  of the royal_family  were  to have been laid_to_rest .
The base  is carved  with floral  motifs , of  roses , tulips , and narcissi . 
Some of the designs  have  up to 60  pieces .
 :42 : On both  sides  of the Taj are  two  identical  red  sandstone  mosques .
The one to the left  holds  Friday  prayers  even  today .
The one to the right , the jawab (answer ) was built  only  for symmetry  and holds  no  prayers  since it faces  away  from the Mecca .
In front of the main  entrance  is  a platform , which is  popular  for use  as a spot  for taking  photographs . 
You will find  many  couples  sitting  on it with the Taj_Mahal  as the backdrop  to pose  for the most  precious  memento  of their visit .
 :46 : On the western  wall  of the compound  is  the museum  there is  a good  collection  of Moghul miniature  paintings   portraits  of the Moghul  rulers , ancient  coins  and porcelain .
The museum  also  has  a gallery  with the original  drawings  of the Taj_Mahal  on display .
They show  how meticulously  the building  was planned , including  an accurate  estimate  of the time  to be taken  for its construction .
Amar Singh Gate , Agra  Fort : Akbar, the greatest  empire builder  of the Moghuls , commissioned the Agra  Fort  in 1565 .
Shah_Jahan  made  alterations  by 
pulling_down  many of the original  buildings  and replacing  them with marble  ones.
His son  Aurangzeb, who was  in constant  conflict  with local  chieftains  and neighboring  principalities , added  the outer  ramparts .
The tourist  entry  is  through the Amar Singh Gate , which was used  by General  Lake and his army  to capture  the fort .
The main  entrance , the Delhi  Gate , is  now  closed .
Much of the fort  is  occupied  by the army  and is  out_of_bounds  for visitors .
However , the buildings  open  to the public  have  some  superb  architectural  sights .
The DiwaniAm or the Hall  of audience  is  a pillared  hall  whose centerpiece  is  the throne  alcove ; this marble  structure  was inlaid  with precious  stones  in floral  motifs , and was built  to house  the Peacock_Throne .
The exquisitely  crafted  throne  was taken  to Delhi  by Shah_Jahan  and was looted  by Nadir Shah and carried_away  to Persia .
The DiwaniKhas, where the emperor  held  audience  with visiting  dignitaries , was built  in 1635 .
It had  two  thrones  on the terrace , one  in white  marble  and one  in black  slate .
Emperor  Shah_Jahan  is believed  to have used  the marble  throne  for repose , and the slate  throne  to watch  elephant  fights  in the courtyard .
Khas Mahal:The Khas Mahal, where the emperor  slept , had  cavities  in its flat  roof  to insulate  it from the hot  winds  of summer .
The Macchi Bhawan, or fish  chamber , had  fountains , tanks  and water  channels  stocked  with fish . 
The emperor  and his courtiers  amused  themselves by angling  here .
 :64 : The Nagina Masjid  was built  in marble  by Shah_Jahan  to be used  exclusively  by the women  of the zenana or harem .

The Sheesh Mahal or Palace  of Mirrors , whose mirrored  walls  reflected  and enhanced  the lamplights , was used  by the women  for bathing .
A two storied  octagonal  tower , the Musamman Burj, is said  to be  the place  from where Shah_Jahan  last  saw  the Taj_Mahal  before dying .
Popularly  known_as  ‘baby  Taj’, this is  the tomb  of Mirza Ghiyath Begh, who was  Wazir or Chief  Minister  in Emperor  Jahangir's court .
He became  a very  powerful  person , more so when the Emperor  Jahangir married  his daughter  Noor Jahan.
The tomb  was designed  by Noor Jahan and was  the first  Moghul building  using  marble  inlay  work .
The Jama Masjid  was built  by Shah_Jahan  and dedicated  to his favourite  daughter  Jahanara Begum. 
It is surrounded  by the crowded  bazaar , which is  interesting  to wander  through  on foot .
 :72 : A kilometer  away  from Itmaduddaulah is  Chini ka rauza, the mausoleum  of Afzal Khan, and the son  of Mirza Ghiyath Begh.
The tomb  derives  its name  from the glazed  tiles  (chini) on its facade .
The Ram Bagh, laid_out  by Babur in 1528  is said  to have been  the restingplace of his body  before it was taken_away  for a final  burial  in Kabul .
Akbar's mausoleum  at Sikandra, 10  kms  from Agra , can be visited  by hiring  an  auto rickshaw  for the day .
The construction  of the mausoleum  was begun  by Akbar himself, and completed  in 1613  by his son  Jahangir.
In_a_way , it is  a synthesis  of the bold  masculine  red  sandstone  structures  built  by Akbar and the delicately  crafted  white  marble  buildings  of Jahangir and Shah_Jahan .
The entrance  is  through a huge  gateway  that blocks  view  of the tomb  from outside .
The tomb  is  in the centre  of the char bagh, gardens  laid_out  in four  quadrants .

In Agra  layers  of history  are peeled  away  to reveal  an amazing  tapestry  of life   of wars  waged , of great  architectural  magnificence  and above_all  a testimony  of the undying  love  of a king  for his queen .
That Agra  is  unparalleled  as a travel  destination  is  an established  fact .
Even  Bill_Clinton  testified  to as much when he declared  the world  was divided  into two : those who have seen  the  Taj  and those who have not !
