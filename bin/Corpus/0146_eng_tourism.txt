Ireland  may be known  as the land  that boasts  40  shades  of green , but not  all  natural  attractions  shimmer  a shade  of emerald .
The Burren was formed  around  340  million  years  ago  at the bottom  of a sea , and is an extraordinary  region  stretching  from north   Clare to south   Galway .
Arrestingly dramatic  in appearance , the Burren’s unique  landscape  includes  miles  of limestone  layers  cut through by meandering  streams , labyrinthine  caves  and unexpected  lakes , a phenomenally  rich  cultural  heritage , including  over 70  percent  of Ireland ’s native  flora .
Burren is also  home  to more_than  500  ringforts and over 80  Neolithic  tombs .
The bizarre  lunar  landscape  of the Giant’s Causeway  may have been caused  by volcanic_eruptions  and cooling  lava , but legend  tells  a different  story . 
The Causeway  (A UNESCO  World  Heritage  Site ) is a mesmerising  collection  of tightly  packed  basalt  columns  that run from the cliffs  of the Antrim Plateau  right  down  to the sea . 
Similar  stones  on the island  of Straffa in the Scottish  Hebrides  led  the ancients  to believe  that it was the work  of giant  Finn MacCool who built  County  Antrim’s Causeway  as a pathway  to Scotland , where a rival  giant  lived .
Ireland  enjoys  over 1 ,448  km  of spectacular  coastline , surrounded  by the mighty  Atlantic  on the west  and the Irish_Sea  on the east .

At 344  km  in length , the River  Shannon is the    longest   river in Ireland  and one of the finest  in Europe . 
Winding  through an area  of outstanding  natural  beauty , this unspoilt  waterway  flows  from the Shannon Pot on the slopes  of the Cuilcagh Mountains  in County   Cavan to Loop Head in County   Clare, where it meets  the Atlantic . 
Rich  in glorious  scenery , filled  with prolific  wildlife , and dotted  with pretty  villages , the Shannon Erne Waterway  is the   longest   navigable  waterway  in Europe , and is a paradise  for nature  lovers , boating  enthusiasts  and those who prefer  the quiet  life .
Isolated  and remote , Ireland ’s islands  resound  with mythical  beauty  and are excellent  hideaways  for those after a holiday    away from it all  .
Many  of Ireland ’s islands  didn’t have electricity  until the 1970 s and a more  traditional  ethos  endures  amongst the islanders . 
For a real  break    away from it all  , try  Coney_Island , Tory Island , Clare Island , Rathlin and the fabled   Aran_Islands .

Puck Fair  in  Kerry, where a goat  is   crowned     king  , is well  worth  a trip , while the Ould Lammas Fair  in North  Antrim draws  crowds  from all  over the world .
The Leprechaun  of Celtic  folktales  is a cantankerous , cranky  little  man  who mends  shoes  for other  fairies , quite  different  from the cheery  folk  created  by the 1959  Walt_Disney  film  Darby O’Gill and The Little  People .
