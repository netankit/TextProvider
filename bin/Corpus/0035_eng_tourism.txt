The Victoria_Falls  offer  an inescapable  closeness  to the natural  elements  
 :2 : The towering  column  of spray  when the river  is high  the thunder  of the falling  water  the terrifying  abyss  that separates  Zimbabwe  from Zambia  the forest   lined  placid  tranquil  lagoons  upstream  in which hippo  and deadly  crocodiles  lurk . 
 :3 : David_Livingstone  reported  the existence  of the Falls  to the outside  world  in 1860 . 
 :4 : The result  was immediate  and from that point  the number  of foreign  visitors  rose  steadily  
 :5 : People  walked , rode  on horseback , or traveled  by oxwagon from the Transvaal  along what was then called  the Hunters Road  (now  the border  between Botswana  and Zimbabwe ) and on reaching  George Westbeech's store  at Pandamatenga, left  their animals  there, safe  from the lethal  bite  of the tsetse_fly , and walked  the remaining  80  kilometers  due  north  to the Falls . 
 :6 : With the conflict  in South_Africa  finally  resolved  and the region  politically  more  stable  tourism  is developing  rapidly  
 :7 : New  activities  are constantly  emerging  and the industry  is becoming  more  and more  sophisticated  
 :8 : Rafting  the wild  rapids  below the Falls  was the first  innovation  more_than  ten  years  ago  
 :9 : Now  the list  of organized  commercial  activities  has expanded  dramatically  
 :10 : Visitors  can kayak  canoe_fish  go  on guided  walking  safaris ; ride  on horseback  lunch  on Livingstone's Island  and in addition to the wellknown  "Flight of Angels", ";for the more  adventurous  there is micro  lighting with stunning  views  of the Falls . 
 :11 : It is the one_and_only  Wonder  which does not  require  a description  by early  historians  and poets_ 
 :12 : It is the one_and_only  Wonder  that does not  need  speculations  concerning  its appearance  size  and shape  
 :13 : It is the oldest  yet  it is the only  surviving  of the Seven  Ancient Wonders  
 :14 : It is the Great_Pyramid  of Giza  
 :15 : At the city  of Giza  a necropolis  of ancient  Memphis  and today  part of Greater  Cairo  Egypt  
 :16 : Contrary  to the common  belief  only the Great_Pyramid  of Khufu  (Cheops ) not  all  three  Great_Pyramids  is on top  of the list  of Wonders  
 :17 : The monument  was built  by the Egyptian  Pharaoh  Khufu  of the Fourth  Dynasty  around the year  2560  BC  to serve  as a tomb  when he died . 
 :18 : The tradition  of pyramid  building  started  in Ancient  Egypt  as a sophistication of the idea  of a mastaba  or "platform " covering  the royal  tomb  
 :19 : Later  several  stacked  mastabas  were used  
 :20 : Early  pyramids  such as the Step Pyramid  of King  Zoser (Djoser) at Saqqara  by the famous  Egyptian  architect  Imhotep, illustrate  this connection  
 :21 : The great  pyramid  is believed  to have been built  over  a 20  year  period  
 :22 : The site  was first  prepared  and blocks  of stone  were transported  and placed  
 :23 : An outer  casing  (which disappeared  over the years ) was then  used  to smooth  the surface  
 :24 : Although it is not known  how the blocks  were put  in place  several  theories  have been proposed  
 :25 : One theory  involves  the construction  of a straight  or spiral  ramp  that was raised  as the construction  proceeded  
 :26 : This ramp , coated  with mud  and water , eased  the displacement  of the blocks  which were pushed  (or pulled ) into place  
 :27 : A second  theory  suggests  that the blocks  were placed  using  long  levers  with a short  angled  foot 
 :28 : Throughout their history  the pyramids  of Giza  have stimulated  human  imagination .
 :29 : They were referred  to as "The Granaries  of Joseph " and "The Mountains  of Pharaoh " 
 :30 : When Napoleon  invaded  Egypt  in 1798 , his pride  was expressed  through his famous  quote  "Soldats! Du haut de ces Pyramides, 40  siècles nous contemplent". 
 :31 : Soldiers ! From the top  of these Pyramids  40  centuries  are looking  at us. 
 :32 : Today  the Great_Pyramid  is enclosed  together  with the other  pyramids  and the Sphinx  in the touristy  region  of the Giza  Plateau  
 :33 : Also  in the area  in the museum  housing  the mysterious  Sun Boat  only discovered  in 1954  near the south  side  of the pyramid ? 
 :34 : The boat  is believed  to have been used  to carry  the body  of Khufu  in his last  journey  on earth  before being buried  inside the pyramid  
 :35 : It may also  serve  him as a means  of transportation  in his afterlife  journey  according  to Ancient  Egyptian  beliefs  
 :36 : When it was built  the Great_pyramid  was 145 .75  m  (481_ft ) high . Over  the years  it lost  10  m  (30  ft ) off its top .
 :37 : It ranked  as the tallest  structure  on Earth  for more_than  43  centuries  only  to be surpassed  in height  in the nineteenth  century  AD . 
 :38 : It was covered  with a casing  of stones  to smooth  its surface  (some of the casing  can still  be seen  near the top  of Khefre's pyramid ) 
 :39 : The sloping  angle  of its sides  is 51  degrees  and 51  minute s Each  side  is carefully  oriented  with one of the cardinal  points  of the compass  that is, north  south  east  and west  
 :40 : The horizontal  cross_section  of the pyramid  is square  at any level  with each  side  measuring  229  m  (751_ft ) in length  
 :41 : The maximum  error  between side_  lengths  is astonishingly  less_than  0 .1 %. 
 :42 : The structure  consists  of approximately  2  million  blocks  of stone  each  weighing  more_than  two  tons  
 :43 : It has been suggested  that there are enough  blocks  in the three  pyramids  to build  a 3  m  (10  ft ) high  0 .3  m  (1  ft ) thick  wall  around France  
 :44 : The area  covered  by the Great_pyramid  can accommodate  St Peter's in Rome  the cathedrals  of Florence  and Milan  and Westminster  and St Paul's in London  combined  
 :45 : On the north  face  is the pyramid  entrance . A number  of corridors  galleries  and escape  shafts  either lead  to the King  burial_chamber  or were intended  to serve  other  functions  
 :46 : The King  chamber  is located  at the heart  of the pyramid  only accessible  through the Great  Gallery  and an ascending  corridor  
 :47 : The King  sarcophagus  is made  of red  granite  as are the interior  walls  of the King  Chamber  
 :48 : Most  impressive  is the sharp edged  stone  over the doorway  which is over 3  m  (10  ft ) long  2 .4  m  (8  feet ) high  and 1 .3  m  (4  ft ) thick . All  of the interior  stones  fit  so  well  a card  won't fit  between them. 
 :49 : The sarcophagus  is oriented    in accordance with   the compass  directions  and is only  about 1  cm  smaller  in dimensions  than the chamber  entrance  
 :50 : It might have been introduced  as the structure  was progressing  
 :51 : Even  extraterrestrial related  theories  have been proposed  with little  evidence  in support . 
 :52 : The overwhelming  scientific  and historic  evidence  still  supports  the conclusion  that, like many  smaller  pyramids  in the region  the Great_Pyramids  were built  by the great  Ancient  Egyptian  civilization  off the West  bank  of the Nile  as tombs  for their magnificent  Kings  
 :53 : Tombs  where Khufu_Khefre , and Menkaure could start  their mystic  journey  to the afterlife  
 :54 : This is the picture  of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon  in most  people's minds  
 :55 : It may be surprising  to know  that they might have never  existed  except in the minds  of Greek  poets  and historians ! 
 :56 : On the east  bank  of the River  Euphrates  about  50  km  south  of Baghdad , Iraq_ 
 :57 : The Babylonian  kingdom  flourished  under the rule  of the famous  King  Hammurabi  (1792 1750  BC ) It was not  until the reign  of Naboplashar (625 605  BC) of the Neo Babylonian  dynasty  that the Mesopotamian civilization  reached  its ultimate  glory  
 :58 : His son  Nebuchadnezzar_II  (604 562  BC ) is credited  for building  the legendary  Hanging Gardens 
 :59 : It is said  that the Gardens were built  by Nebuchadnezzar  to please  his wife  or concubine  who had been "brought_up  in Media and had a passion  for mountain  surroundings " 
 :60 : While the most  descriptive  accounts  of the Gardens come from Greek  historians  such as Berossus and Diodorus Siculus, Babylonian  records  stay  silent  on the matter  
 :61 : Tablets  from the time  of Nebuchadnezzar  do not  have a single  reference  to the Hanging Gardens although descriptions  of his palace  the city  of Babylon  and the walls  are found  
 :62 : Even  the historians  who give detailed  descriptions  of the Hanging Gardens never  saw  them. 
 :63 : Modern  historians  argue  that when Alexander  soldiers  reached  the fertile  land  of Mesopotamia  and saw  Babylon  they were impressed  
 :64 : When they later  returned  to their rugged  homeland  they had stories  to tell  about the amazing  gardens and palm_trees  at Mesopotamia  
 :65 : And it was the imagination  of poets  and ancient  historians  that blended  all  these elements  together  to produce  one  of the World  Wonders  
 :66 : It wasn't until the twentieth  century  that some of the mysteries  surrounding  the Hanging Gardens were revealed  
 :67 : Archaeologists  are still  struggling  to gather  enough  evidence  before reaching  the final  conclusions  about the location  of the Gardens their irrigation  system  and their true  appearance  
 :68 : Some recent  researchers  even  suggest  that the Hanging Gardens were built  by Senaherib, not  by Nebuchadnezzar_II  (ca. 100  years  earlier ) 
 :69 : Detailed  descriptions  of the Gardens come from ancient  Greek  sources  including  the writings  of Strabo and Philo of Byzantium  
 :70 : "The Garden is quadrangular  and each  side  is four  plethoras  long 
 :71 : It consists  of arched  vaults  which are located  on checkered  cube like  foundations  
 :72 : The ascent  of the uppermost  terrace roofs  is made by a stairway_ .
 :73 : "The Hanging Garden" has plants  cultivated  above ground_level  and the roots  of the trees  are embedded  in an upper  terrace  rather than in the earth . 
 :74 : The whole  mass  is supported  on stone  columns . Streams  of water  emerging  from elevated  sources  flow  down  sloping  channels  
 :75 : These waters  irrigate  the whole  garden  saturating  the roots  of plants  and keeping  the whole  area  moist  
 :76 : Hence  the grass  is permanently  green  and the leaves  of trees  grow  firmly  attached  to supple  branches . This is a work_of_art  of royal  luxury  and its most  striking  feature  is that the labor  of cultivation  is suspended  above the heads  of the spectators " 
 :77 : More recent  archaeological  excavations  at the ancient  city  of Babylon  in Iraq  uncovered  the foundation  of the palace  
 :78 : Other  findings  include  the Vaulted  Building  with thick  walls  and irrigation  well  near  the southern  palace  
 :79 : A group  of archaeologists  surveyed  the area  of the southern  palace  and reconstructed  the Vaulted  Building  as the Hanging Gardens 
 :80 : However  the Greek  historian  Strabo had stated  that the gardens  were situated  by the River  Euphrates  
 :81 : So others argue  that the site  is too  far  from the Euphrates  to support  the theory  since the Vaulted  Building  is several  hundreds  of meters  away  
 :82 : They reconstructed  the site  of the palace  and located  the Gardens in the area  stretching  from the River  to the Palace  
 :83 : On the river_banks , recently  discovered  massive  walls  25  m  thick  may have been stepped  to form  terraces  the ones described  in Greek  references  
 :84 : This is the statue  of the god  in whose honor  the Ancient  Olympic_games  were held . It was located  on the land  that gave its very  name  to the Olympics  
 :85 : At the time  of the games  wars  stopped  and athletes  came  from Asia_Minor , Syria  Egypt  and Sicily to celebrate  the Olympics  and to worship  their king  of gods  Zeus  
 :86 : At the ancient  town of Olympia  on the west  coast  of modern  Greece  about  150  km  west  of Athens  
 :87 : The ancient  Greek  calendar  starts  in 776  BC  for the Olympic_games  are believed  to have started  that year_ 
 :88 : The magnificent  temple  of Zeus  was designed  by the architect  Libon and was built  around  450  BC  
 :89 : Under the growing  power  of ancient  Greece  the simple  Doric style  temple  seemed  too  mundane  and modifications  were needed  and the solution A majestic  statue  
 :90 : The Athenian  sculptor  Pheidias  was assigned  for the "sacred " task  reminiscent  of Michelangelo  paintings  at the Sistine Chapel  
 :91 : For the years  that followed  the temple  attracted  visitors  and worshippers  from all_over  the world  
 :92 : In the first  century  AD  the Roman_emperor  Caligula  attempted  to transport  the statue  to Rome  
 :93 : However , his attempt  failed  when the scaffolding  built  by Caligula  workmen  collapsed  
 :94 : After the Olympic_games  were banned  in AD  391  by the emperor  Theodosius  I as Pagan  practices  the temple  of Zeus  was ordered  closed  
 :95 : Olympia  was further  struck  by earthquakes  landslides  and floods  and the temple  was damaged  by fire  in the fifth  century  AD  
 :96 : Earlier  the statue  had been transported  by wealthy  Greeks  to a palace  in Constantinople  
 :97 : Today  nothing  remains  at the site  of the old  temple  except rocks  and debris  the foundation  of the buildings  and fallen  columns 
 :98 : Pheidias  began  working  on the statue  around  440  BC . Years  earlier  he had developed  a technique  to build  enormous  gold  and ivory  statues  
 :99 : This was done  by erecting  a wooden  frame  on which sheets  of metal  and ivory  were placed  to provide  the outer  covering  
 :100 : Pheidias ' workshop  in Olympia  still  exists  and is coincidentally   or may be not   identical  in size  and orientation  to the temple  of Zeus
