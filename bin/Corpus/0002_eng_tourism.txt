Antarctica  is  not  easy  to access  but that is  part  of its appeal .
 :2 : Amidst such  solitude , adventurous  travelers  will discover  an ethereal  landscape  that lingers  in the memory .
 :3 : Very  few  have ventured  onto the continent  and those who do  will usually  rave  about the privilege  of gazing  upon topography  that yields  towering  mountains , bulky  glaciers  and luminous , dreamlike  icebergs , carved  into curious  shapes .
Perhaps  more_than  anywhere  else , Antarctica  reminds  those who visit  it of the awesome  (and savage ) power  of nature .
 :5 : No  two  travelers  will ever  see  the same  icebergs  forged  in exactly  the same  form , such is  its ephemeral  and austere  beauty .
 :6 : However , some argue  that Antarctica  is changing , and by man_made  causes  rather than natural  ones.
 :7 : Antarctica  is welcoming  more  tourist orientated  cruises  and ferries  to the region  every  year , and facilities  are continually  developing , with more  accommodation , culinary  and travel  options  available .
There is  now  ample  opportunity  to ascend  Mount  Erebus, the southernmost  active  volcano  on Earth ; to fly  via helicopter  or venture  by boat  to penguin  colonies ; to really   make the most of  a terrain  that teems  with wildlife , with a multitude  of birds , seals , albatrosses  and enormous  whales  and_so_on .
 :9 : Some regard  this gradual  focus  on tourism  as disconcerting  – many wish  to preserve  Antarctica  in its elemental  state  and want  to avoid  any  potential  environmental  damage .
 :10 : However , the focus  on tourism  is , indeed , gradual , and as long as any  visitor  is  aware  of their impact  upon the landscape  and does  their utmost  to limit  that impact , Antarctica  is  still  a magical  experience  that most, given  the chance , would find  hard  to resist .
 :11 : It has only  been  a little  over 100  years  since humans  first  occupied  the continent  (1899 ) and only  nearly  200  years  since seafarers  first  even  saw  the islands  of the Antarctic_Peninsula  (1819 ).
 :12 : Before this, the continent  was  the subject  of constant  speculation , spoken  of in almost  mythical  terms  as Terra Australis Incognita – the Unknown  Southern  Land .
 :13 : Even  once  known , Antarctica  seemed  inhospitable  and incomprehensible  and, in many  ways , it still  is .
 :14 : But it seems  fitting  that the continent  should be  the site  for numerous  global  research  stations , proving  it remains  a testament  to human  endeavor .
 :16 : Throughout the country  colonial  history , Bolivia  was  known  as 'Upper Peru', until after 
Simon_Bolivar  led  the country  to independence  in 1825 , when it was named  in his honor .
Therefore , the country  name  instigates  great  national  pride , which has unfortunately  been marred  by years  of turmoil  and tyranny  under the lead  of Caudillos (military  dictators ).
 :18 : Liberation  retains  a dual  meaning  in Bolivia ; a country  of great  expanse , extensive  lakes  and salt_plains  induce  an elated  sense  of freedom  for any  traveler .
But there is  little  of such freedom  for Bolivians , many of whom account_for  some of the poorest  people  in Latin_America .
 :20 : Although Bolivia  has entered  an unprecedented  era  of political  stability , it follows  a record  of 192  coups  in the 156  years  from independence  to 1981 .
 :21 : The fight  to keep  their land  mirrors  the Bolivians  fight  to preserve  their traditions , such as the Pachamama ('Mother  Earth '); shrines  to her are found  everywhere .
 :22 : 'Mother  Earth ' is  kind  in_return : Bolivia  is  beautiful  and striking ; there are  currently  10  national_parks  and eight  protected  areas .
 :23 : Although Bolivia  is  landlocked , it never  feels  claustrophobic  – blessed  with breathtaking  lakes  and lofty  mountains .
 :24 : It is  difficult  to know  what is  more  breathtaking : the Bolivian  gentle  struggle  to survive  amidst a  legacy  of poverty  and unrest , or the Altiplano ascending  ever  higher .
 :25 : Standing  as  tall  as the mountains , the Bolivians  pride  for their homeland  is  always  evident  – and always  justified . 
 :26 : Brazil  is  South_America  biggest  and most  influential  country  and takes_up  almost  half  the continent .
 :27 : It is  one of the world  economic  giants  and is  revered  for its football  prowess , coffee  production  and distinctive  music  such as samba  and  bossa nova .
 :28 : Twothirds  of Brazil  population  lives  near the coast , meaning  that life is a beach for  locals  and tourists  alike .
 :29 : People  are  the essence  of the country , and while Brazil  is  home  to a multitude  of ethnic  groups  of varying  economic  status , there are  some  characteristics  that everyone shares   energy  and passion .
 :30 : Brazilians  enjoy  a good  party  whatever  the circumstances .
 :31 : Rio  is  the hottest  of destinations , particularly  around Carnival  time .
 :32 : Dancers  gyrate , the music  beats  and the summer  temperature  rises .
 :33 : Bodies  of all  ages , colors  and sizes  don  the very  minimum  in beachwear  and idle  away the days  on the sun kissed  Copacabana and Ipanema beaches .
 :34 : Brazil  landscape  is  as  diverse  as the people  who inhabit  it.
 :35 : Few  tourists  venture  far  from Brazil  spectacular  beaches  but a trip  into the interior  reveals  a different  Brazil , one with a great_deal  to offer  the visitor .
 :36 : As well as the world  biggest  rainforest  in the Amazon , Brazil  boasts  of many  wilderness  areas  including  the wildlife rich  wetlands  of the Pantanal, the canyons  and caves  of the Chapada Diamentina, and the Mata Atlantica (Atlantic  forest ), which runs  for much of the length  of Brazil  coastline .
 :37 : The population  of Brazil  is  a big  melting_pot of races , including  indigenous  people , descendants  of slaves  from Africa  and the offspring  of European  immigrants .
 :38 : This variety  is reflected  in the food , architecture , music  and culture  of Brazil .
 :39 : It is  this massive  assortment  of places , people  and traditions  that makes  Brazil  such  an interesting  country  to visit .
Chile  is  situated  in South_America , bounded  by Peru , Bolivia , Argentina , the Antarctic  and the Pacific_Ocean .
 :43 :  :40 : Home  of the Andes  mountain_range , it is  a thin  ribbon  of land , 4 ,200  km  (2 ,610  miles ) long  and nowhere  more_than  180  km  (115  miles ) wide .
 :41 : The Araucanian Indians  were  the original  inhabitants  of Chile .
 :42 : The Spanish  conquered  the country  in the 16 th  century  and ruled  until the country  independence  in 1818 .
 :43 : As a result  of the War  of the Pacific  (1879 1883 ), Chile  gained  Tarapacá, Tacna and Arica from Bolivia , and 
took_control  of the Atacama.
 :44 : Border  disputes  between Chile  and Bolivia  have been  a recurrent  element  in Chile  history  ever since.
 :45 : Elections  in 1970  brought  Unidad Popular, led  by the Marxist  Dr Salvador Allende, to power .
 :46 : A military  coup  followed , during which Allende committed_suicide  rather than surrender  to his attackers .
 :47 : General  Augusto Pinochet Ugarte was declared  Supreme  Chief_of_State  and president , and remained  in power  despite considerable  opposition  from many  sectors  of society .
The ruling  military_junta  assumed  wideranging  powers , its main  aim  being  to eliminate  the Communist_Party  and other  leftist  opposition .
 :49 : During the 'state  of siege ', political  opponents  were imprisoned  (and many of them 'disappeared '), censorship  was  systematic  and all  non government  political  activity  banned .
 :50 : These powers  were  gradually  relaxed  during the 1980 s.
 :51 : Patricio Aylwin, leader  of the Concertación de los Partidos de la Democracia (CPD), a 17 party  coalition  in which the Christian Democrats (PCD), usually  classified  as  centreleft , in contrast  with European  practice ) were  the largest  component , stood  against the General  and won  in the presidential  elections  of December  1989 .
 :52 : In 1998 , Pinochet officially  retired  and Chile  has begun  to  come to terms  with his  legacy .
 :53 : His arrest  and subsequent  detention  in London  in October  1998  following  an extradition  request  from Spain  polarized  Chilean  society .
 :54 : It also  broke  a taboo , culminating  in  court  decisions  which stripped  him of his immunity  from prosecution  although the former  ruler  has not  been prosecuted  yet .
 :55 : Because of its unusual   geography , Chile  has  a hugely  varied  climate  ranging  from the world  driest  desert  in the north , through a Mediterranean  climate  in the centre , to a snow prone  Alpine  climate  in the south .
 :56 : Travelers  will enjoy  the country  abundant  fauna  and flora  and spectacular  scenery  consisting  of huge  glaciers , fjords , waterfalls , blue  lakes  and numerous  national_parks  where trekking  is  a very  popular  activity  amongst tourists .
 :57 : The Republic_of_Colombia  was formally  established  in 1855 .
 :58 : Over the next  100  years , Colombian  politics  were dominated  by the Conservative Liberal  feud , which often  broke_out  into warfare .
 :59 : Periods  of democratic  government  alternated  with dictatorships .
 :60 : There were  occasions , however , when the two  parties  were  able  to unite  to  see off  a common  threat .
 :61 : The 1970  election  was  a turning_point  in Colombia  recent  history .
 :62 : Disaffected  members  of ANAPO (Alianza Nacional Popular) formed  a guerrilla  movement  known_as  Movimiento 19  de Abril (M19 ), which initiated  a 15 year long  guerrilla  campaign  against the government  and acquired  other  leftwing  groups .
 :63 : Meanwhile , a third  potent  force  emerged  during the 1980 s, in the form  of organized  drug_traffickers  (known_as  cartels ).
 :64 : Large  sums_of_money  began  to be turned  into political  power  and leading  politicians  increasingly  became tainted  by connections  with drug  money .
 :65 : By 1998 , the country  was  in the grip  of the struggle  between the government , traffickers , rightwing  paramilitaries  and leftwing  guerrillas .
 :66 : Leftist  guerrillas  created  'liberated  areas ', within which government  forces  were  unable  or unwilling  to operate .
 :67 : The US  administration  became  infuriated  and, in 2000 , the US  Clinton_administration  unveiled  'Plan  Colombia ', a massive  military  support  programme  for the Colombian  armed_forces .
 :68 : Although portrayed  as the latest  phase  of the 'war  on drugs ', it is  clear  that the programme  is  essentially  political  and strategic  – the objective  is  to destroy  FARC  
(Revolutionary_Armed_Forces_of_Colombia ) and its allies .
 :69 : The Bush_administration  inherited  'Plan  Colombia ' after victory  at the US  November  2000  poll  and endorsed  the plan  with some  modifications .
 :70 : Its first  effects  became  apparent  the following  year , when military_forces  retook  part  of the former  'liberated  zone '.
 :71 : The new  hard_line  adopted  by the government  was confirmed  in May  2002 , when the rightwinger  Alvaro Uribe, who favours  allout  war  against the leftwing  guerrillas , won  a comfortable  victory  at the presidential  election .
 :72 : Uribe immediately  declared  a partial  state  of emergency , allowing  him to impose  security_measures  by decree .
 :73 : In early  2003 , American  special_forces  troops  became directly  engaged  for the first  time  in the eastern  province  of Arauca.
Yet  what has endured  in the midst  of such  everchanging , violent  proceedings is  a calm  and beautiful  landscape  that has  much  to offer , from nature  (much  is covered  by the Amazon  Basin ; large  lakes  are surrounded  by mountains ; a Caribbean  coastline  twinkles  with azure  water ) to manmade  wonders  (archaeological  digs  unearth  historical  wealth ; colonial  houses  adorn  the towns ; the Guajira Peninsula  is  home  to more_than  100 ,000  nomadic  Indians ).
 :75 : There must be  hope  that the political  climate  becomes  just  as  clement  very  soon .
 :76 : Ecuador  (including  the ancient  Kingdom  of Quito, established  by the Shiris) was populated  by several  mutually  antagonistic  tribes  at the time  of the Inca  conquest  in the mid  15 th  century .
 :77 : When the Spanish  arrived  from Peru  in the 1530 s, they found  that while many of the inhabitants  were  hostile , others hailed  them as liberators  from Inca  repression .
 :78 : Spanish  rule  lasted  until the early  19 th  century  – after suppressing  several  rebellions , the Spaniards  were finally  overthrown  in 1822 , by a force  backed  by Simon_Bolivar , fresh  from victory  in Colombia .
 :79 : Soon  afterwards , in 1828 , the country  declared  war  on Peru , whose armies  had invaded  Gran Colombia.
 :80 : A year  later , a peace_treaty  was signed  and Ecuador  boundaries  were permanently  established .
 :81 : However , relations  between Ecuador  and Peru  have been  tense  ever  since.
 :82 : Today , Ecuador  remains  a multiethnic  and multicultural  nation , where more_than  14  indigenous  groups  maintain  their own  traditions  and ways_of_life , to the delight  of visitors .
 :83 : The discovery  of oil  and the sharp  increase  in world  oil  prices  in the late  and mid  70 s should have transformed  Ecuador  economic  fortunes .
 :84 : However , the windfall  was largely  squandered  and Ecuador  has suffered  persistent  economic  difficulties  ever since.
 :85 : The Minister  of Tourism , Maria Isabel Salvador, has put  as goal  for the short  and medium  term  to turn  Ecuador  into one of the five  best  destinations  of the American  continent .
To make  tourism  a tool  that enables  the country  to surpass  poverty , she considers  that there must be  ample  cooperation  between the authorities , the public  sector  and citizens  in_general .
 :87 : The country  varied  and beautiful  landscape  should make  this goal  feasible .
 :88 : Straddling  the equator  in western  South_America , Ecuador  has  territories  in both  the Northern  and the Southern  hemispheres .
 :89 : The country  is geographically  divided  into the Amazon , the Highlands , the Coast , and the 
Galapagos_Islands .
 :90 : Ecuador  coastal  region  (the western  lowlands ) is made_up  of fertile  plains , rolling  hills , and sedimentary  basins  traversed  by a plethora  of rivers  that rush  from the heights  of the Andes  to the Pacific_Ocean .
 :91 : All  five  coastal  provinces , encompassing  640 km  (398  miles ) of coastline  between them, have  attractive  beaches  and plenty  of hotels  and resorts  for tourists .
 :92 : The Andes  Mountain_Range  crosses  the country  from north  to south .
 :93 : The Amazon  Region  can be geographically  divided  into two   subregions : the High  Amazon  and the Amazon  Lowlands .
 :94 : The Highlands  is comprised  of the Andean  foothills  which slowly  descend  towards the Amazon  River_Basin .
 :95 : The most  impressive  elevated  regions  of this area  are  in the north  and include  Volcano  Sumaco.
 :96 : The Lowlands , found  further  to the east , are  home  to some of the nation  most  beautiful  and important  rivers : the Putumayo, the Napo, and the Pastaza.
The Archipelago  of Colon (commonly  known_as  the Galapagos_Islands ) is made_up  of 13  main  islands , 17  islets , and dozens  of ancient  rock  formation .
 :98 : Apart from its beautiful  beaches  and unique  and varied  ecosystems , the Galapagos_Islands  are  home  to towering  active  volcanoes .
 :99 : Until the war  of 1982 , the rainy , windswept  
Falkland_Islands  were  a forgotten  remnant  of the old  British_Empire .
