Home  of the British  Government , the building  is  actually  called  the Palace  of Westminster , but is  more  commonly  known_as  the 
Houses_of_Parliament , due_to  the two  parts  of government  that live  here . 
 :3 : These are  the elected  House_of_Commons  and the House_of_Lords , made_up  of hereditary  and life  peers .
 :5 : The  Commons  introduces  new  legislation  but the  Lords  acts  as a kind  of quality_control  department  and debates  the issues  again , before they are  made  law .

 :9 : When Daniel_Defoe  visited  Westminster Hall  during his tour  of 1724 , he said  that it resembled  a barn . 
 :10 :  A fire  in 1834  destroyed  all but Westminster Hall  and the Jewel Tower  across the road , so the rest  of the present  building  is  surprisingly  new , having been built  in the period  1840 1860  to a mock Gothic  design .
 :11 : Strangely , the hall  tends  to be  ignored , except for on state  occasions .
 :12 : Visitors  to the public  gallery  do pass_through  the end  of the hall  on their way  in  through the airport  style  security  checks .
 :13 : A century  ago  in Dickens ' day , the hall  was  a more  focal  point .
 :14 : When Parliament  is sitting  a light  is turned_on  above the Clock_Tower  that houses  Big_Ben , and a flag  is flown  from Victoria Tower  (the tall  tower  at the opposite  end  from Big_Ben  
 :15 : Clock_Tower ).
 :16 :  On the corner  near Parliament Square  a beacon  flashes  and a bell  rings  when a Member_of_Parliament  wants  a taxicab . 
 :17 : Visitors  are  welcome  in both  the  Lords ' and  Commons  public  galleries  when the houses  are sitting .
 :18 : The queue  for the  Commons  can be  quite  large  during the afternoon  but the house  sits  until around  10   to 4 pm  and during the evening  there is  often  no  need  to queue .
 :19 : Arrangements  must be made  in_advance  to tour  around the rest  of the Palace , if you live  in the_UK , otherwise arrangements  can be made  through your embassy .

 :21 : At the road  junction  next to the Houses_of_Parliament  is Parliament Square .
 :22 : This small  area  of grass  is  an oasis  in a sea  of traffic .
 :23 : There are  now  plans  to  pedestrianise  the area  around the square  and also  Whitehall  and Trafalgar_Square , but at the moment  the traffic  deters  many  people  from reaching  the square .
 :24 : Those who do  will find  statues  honoring  a number  of past  British  Prime_Ministers .
 :25 : There is  also  one  of Abraham_Lincoln  (1809 1865 ), the 16 th  President_of_the_USA . 
 :26 : Opposite 'The House ' is  a green  and grassy  area  where news  crew  conduct  interviews  with politicians .
 :27 : This is  known  variously  as 'Abingdon Green', 'College Green' and 'St Stephen's Green'.
 :28 : The official   line  though, from the Head  of Public  Information  at the Palace  of Westminster , is  that it's just  called  'The Green'.
 :29 : Similarly , the Clock_Tower  that houses  Big_Ben , the giant  13 .5 ton  bell  that strikes  the hour , is  simply  called  'The Clock Tower'!

 :63 : The emphasis  remains  on providing  for the community  of people  who live  here .
 :64 :  Nearly  all of Marylebone is owned  by Lord  Howard De Walden who has been  careful  to ensure  that old  residents  have not  been   priced out  of their houses  and that the area  has not  become  overtly  commercial .

meeting_place .
