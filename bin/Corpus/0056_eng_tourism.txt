The bridge  was  more_than  just  a river  crossing  though .
It had  its own  chapel  and many  shops  and houses  too .
The third  one was designed  by John Rennie and built  in 1832  by his son , after his death .
It was painstakingly  dismantled  and then  reconstructed  in the Arizona  Desert  where it still  stands  and carries  six  lanes  of traffic .
 William McGonagall (1825 1902 ) found  the bridge  extremely  busy  when he visited  London  and wrote  his awful  poem  'Jottings of London'.
The bridge  also  inspired  the famous  nursery_rhyme  'London Bridge is falling down'!  
The current  rather  dull  looking  bridge  was completed  in 1972 .
In the 2 nd  century , London  (then  called  Londinium) was controlled  by the Roman  invaders  and a wall  was built  to protect  it.
 Today  sections  of this city  wall  are  still  visible , mingling  among the office  blocks .
Cross_sections  of parts  of the wall  show  where medieval  Londoners  continued  to maintain  and add  to the wall .
 Areas  of London  still  bear  the names  of the gates  in the wall , the main  ones being  Aldgate, Cripplegate, Bishopsgate, Newgate and Ludgate.
 Large  sections  of the wall  can be seen  close  to the Museum  of London  and near Tower Hill station  next to the Tower_of_London .
A sign_posted  walk  runs  along the path  of the wall  between these two  locations .
The Mall is  the grand  road  that leads  from Trafalgar_Square , through Admiralty Arch  and on to the
Buckingham_Palace .
 A wide  and straight  road , it is  at its best  when being used  for royal  ceremonies , when Union_Jacks  or the national  flags  of visiting  heads_of_state  are flown  from flagpoles , along the length  of the road .
 The Mall as we see  it today  was designed  at the beginning  of this century  by the architect  Aston Webb, who also  designed  the Victoria Monument  and rebuilt  the front  of the Buckingham_Palace  around the same  time .
 The Mall cuts_through  the middle  of royal  London .
On one  side  is  St James's Park , leading  to The Horse Guard's Parade_Ground .
On the other  side  is  the Green Park  and past  royal  residences , Lancaster House , Marlborough House , Spencer House  and St James's Palace .
Also  on that side  is Clarence House , the home  of the Queen_Mother , a sort  of royal  granny  flat .
Opposite the Bank_of_England , it is  the official  home  of the Lord Mayor  of London .
There is  an underground  station  nearby , named  after the house , although it is  actually  nearer  to Bank station .
Unfortunately  the building  is  not  open  to the public .
If it were , you could see  the cells  where prisoners  were held  awaiting  trial  in the Mansion House Magistrates Court .
Victorian  women  rights  campaigner , 
Mrs. Pankhurst was  one of those once  held  in the cells .
 :28 :_Sir_Christopher_Wren  designed  this house , which overlooks  St James's Park , in the early  18 th  century , as the London  home  of the Duke_of_Marlborough  and his wife , Sarah.
Since then  it has been  home  for many  members  of the royal_family , including  Edward_VII  and Alexandria, when they were  Prince  and Princess  of Wales .
The lavish  entertainment  of their friends , 'The Marlborough House Set', was  legendary .
Queen  Mary lived  here  as a widow  and her son , Edward_VIII  told  her of his intention  to abdicate  in this house .
It has also  been used  as a meeting_place  for members  of the Commonwealth_of_Nations  since 1962  and is , alas , not  open  to the public .
The Nat West Tower was  previously  the head  office  of a British  bank  and is  now  The International  Financial  Centre .
It is  not  open  to the public  and so is  of little  interest  apart from dominating  the city  skyline .
It does, however , have  one  claim  to fame   at 600  feet  it is  the second  tallest  building  in Britain , after the much  prettier  Canary Wharf Tower  in Docklands.
Also , in the early  part  of 1996 , the building  
caught_fire  and almost  became  a towering  inferno .
Following a major  rebuild  of the interior , the building  reopened  in 1997 , renamed  as The International  Financial  Centre .
 Large  bags , cameras , phones , radios  and cassette_recorders  cannot be brought  into the court  and unfortunately  there are  no  facilities  to leave  them outside .
The proper_name  for these courtrooms  is  the Central  Criminal_Court , but they are  more  commonly  known_as  the Old_Bailey , as is  the street  in which they stand , after the medieval  defenses  that were  once  on the site .
The Old_Bailey  was built  in the early  1900 's on the site  of the old  Newgate  Prison .
Court  number  one  is  the most  interesting , with its original  furniture  and dock  leading  to the detention_cells  below .
This court  is generally  used  for the most  serious  of cases .
In the past  many  notorious  murderers  have been tried  in that court , including  Dr Crippen, the Victorian  wife killer  who was  the first  man  to be caught  by the use  of a radio_signal , when he tried  to flee  London  for his home  in America .
Each  court  contains  a public  gallery  open  to anyone (aged  14  or over), interested  in watching  justice  in action , and it is  well  worth  a visit .
Following  a terrorist  bomb  attack  in the 1980 's strict  rules  on baggage  have been implemented .
Photography  is  also  strictly  forbidden  and cameras  cannot even  be taken  inside .
This rule  also  applies  to phones , radios  and cassette_recorders , and unfortunately  there are  no  facilities  for leaving  such items  outside the court .
Opposite the Old_Bailey  is  the Church  of the Holy Sepulcher.
Look  out for the drinking_fountain  set  in the church  wall ; it was  the first  metropolitan  public  drinking_fountain  and was originally  erected  on Holborn Hill  in 1859 .
It was moved  to its present  position  in 1867  when the Holborn viaduct  was built .
Marble Arch  was marooned  in the middle  of this roundabout  in the mid  19 th  century .
Originally  John Nash built  it as a gateway  for 
Buckingham_Palace , but the great  architect  got  it wrong  and made  it too  small  for the royal  coaches .
So it was moved  to its present  site  and now  stands  surrounded  by a chaotic  mass  of traffic . 
It is  only  accessible  through a confusing  rabbit_warren  of smelly  underground  tunnels , or by dicing  with death  crossing  the road .
The subways  below the Marble Arch  are  also  a favorite  pitch  for beggars .
The area  covering  Regent's Park  was  formerly  a church_property  called  Manor  of Tyburn. 
This park  was created  in 1812  for the Prince  Regent , and the original  plan  was  to create  a private  development  with exclusive  houses , but the full  scheme  was never  completed .
Instead  we have been left  a beautifully  landscaped  park  designed  by John Nash, with features  including  a boating  lake , rock_gardens , sunken_gardens  and 
rose_gardens . 
There is  a bandstand , where bands  play  throughout the summer  months .
Also , during the summer  the openair  theatre  produces  a variety  of plays . 
Situated  in the middle  of the park , the openair  theatre  unique  atmosphere  makes  it a marvelous  place  to see  a play . 
 :66 : It specializes  in Shakespeare ’s works , although other  plays  and musicals  are also  performed  during the summer .
A word  of warning  though   the English  weather  is  unpredictable  and performances  are only  cancelled  when it’s extremely  bad   so bring  a raincoat  and a brolly !
The small  park , next to the Victoria Tower  end  of the Houses_of_Parliament , offers  a peaceful  change  from the bustling  crowds  outside the Parliament , and even  noisier  rabble  within .
The park  contains  a bronze  sculpture  made  by Rodin  in 1895  of 'The Burghers  of Calais ' (the residents  of Calais  in France  who surrendered  to Edward_III  in 1347 , during the Hundred  Year  War  between Britain  and France ).
There is  also  a statue  of Emmeline Pankhurst (1858 1928 ), the British  suffragette , whose efforts  finally  won  women  the right_to_vote .
Looking  across the river  from here  you can see  Lambeth Palace  and the Museum  of Garden  History .
Television  companies  often  use  both  this park  and the grassy  area  across the road  near the Jewel Tower , where they interview  politicians . 
The grassy  area  is  known  variously  as College Green , Abingdon Green  and St Stephens Green . 
The London  Dungeon   Deep  in the heart  of London , buried  beneath the paving_stones  of the historic  Southward, lies  the world  most   chillingly  famous  horror  attraction .
The London  Dungeon  brings  more_than  2 ,000  years  of gruesomely  authentic  history  vividly  back  to life  and death .
As you delve into the darkest  chapters  of our grim  and bloody  past , recreated  in all its dreadful  detail , remember , everything you experience  really  happened .search
A warning   in the Dungeon  dark  catacombs  it always  pays   to keep your wits about you . 
Some of the 'exhibits ' have  an unnerving  habit  of coming_back  to life .
 :79 : Today , the London Eye has become , quite  literally , the way  the world  sees  London .
It is  one of the most  spectacular  and popular  attractions  in the world , drawing  visitors  from 
far_and_wide .
Its success  is  unquestionable , as is  its popularity  with tourists  and Londoners  alike .
Yet  it was conceived , designed  and built  against considerable  odds .
Of all the remarkable  facts  about the London Eye, perhaps  the most  astonishing  is  that it was ever  built  at_all .
It is  one of London  few  attractions  that enjoy  a significant  portion  of repeat  business , say  no  more .
The London Eye River  Cruise  Experience  departs conveniently  from the London Eye pier  located  next to the London Eye itself.
The highlights  of the 40  minute  circular  cruise  include  St Paul's Cathedral , the Houses_of_Parliament , Tower_of_London , and HMS Belfast, Shakespeare  Globe, Tate Modern and the Millennium bridge .
It includes  live  commentary  and a souvenir  guide  map  (map  in seven  languages ).
It is  suitable  in all  weather  as the boat  has  both covered  and sun_deck  seating .
Both  the decks  are  accessible  for wheel_chair  users .
Foreign  language  audio  commentary  is  available  in French , Spanish , German , Dutch , Italian , Russian  and Japanese .
The boats  leave  hourly  from 11 :45  am , the last  Cruise  sets_off  at 6 :45  pm  (October  to March   4 .45  pm ). 
Porter's Restaurant   English  food : Porters English  Restaurant , less_than  10  minutes  walk  from the London Eye  in the heart  of Covent Garden's theatre  land  is  famous  for serving  excellent  homemade  real  English  food .
 :93 : Covent Garden Grill  (as the name  suggests ) is  in London  Covent Garden and less_than  10  minutes  stroll  from the London Eye.
Intimate  yet  bright , the grill  is  popular  with both   locals  and tourists  without ever  becoming  oppressively  packed .
The ground_floor  is  divided_up  into sumptuous  leather  upholstered  booths , whilst downstairs  the ambience  is  slightly  calmer  with plenty  of room  and a feeling  of  exclusivity .
Apart from the extremely  tempting  menu  choices  there is  an excellent  wine  list  (sensibly  priced ) obviously  selected  by someone  with knowledge .
The list  of beers  and lagers  is  equally  interesting ; there are  about  two  dozen  to choose  from.
This is  the famous  waxworks  started  by Madame_Tussaud  in 1835  and is  now  one of the most  popular  tourist  attractions  in London  with over two  million  visitors  a year .
There are  wax  models  of the famous  and infamous  from every  walk_of_life .
So whether you want  to mingle  with kings  and queens  or the latest  pop  stars , this is  the place  to go .
New  models  are being produced  all_the_time  while the  havebeens  are quietly  removed  from display  and put  into storage .
Over the years  hundreds  of celebrities  have 
 made their way  to Madame_Tussaud  'stage_door ' to be received  in the private  studio  where the sculptor  makes  precise  measurements  and photographs  the subject  head  from every  possible  angle .
Another  highlight  is  'The Spirit of London'  exhibition  which covers  a period  of more_than  400  years  and spans  London  history  from Elizabethan  times  to the present  day , capturing  the essence  of London  pomp  and circumstance .
Sights , sounds  and even  smells  combine  to tell  the colorful  story  of Britain  capital  city  to visitors  traveling  in cars  specially  designed  to resemble  London  taxicabs  but thankfully , without the drivers ! 
Indeed , the cars  were actually  made  by the same  company  who build  real  London  taxis ! 
Over 70  figures  are involved  in 'The Spirit of London', many of which are  animated  and fused  with a host  of special_effects .
 :106 : Before Madame_Tussaud  had established  herself in London , her collection  of wax  figures  toured  all  around the country  in wagons  and caravans .
Her macabre  collection  of relics  from the French_Revolution , alongside  portraits  of torturers , villains  and murderers , proved  irresistible  to the visiting  public .
To protect  society  ladies  of a delicate  temperament , the collection  of unsavory  characters  was kept  distinct  from the rest  of the exhibition  in an area  known_as  'The Separate Room'.
In 1846  the satirical  magazine , Punch, coined  the term  'Chamber of Horrors'.
Adjoining   Madame Tussauds  is  the London  Planetarium .
