European  voyages  of discovery  began  when Columbus  discovered  the islands  of the 
"New_World " in 1492 .
Written  records  about life  in Florida  began  with the arrival  of the Spanish  explorer  and adventurer  Juan Ponce de León in 1513 .
Sometime  between April  2  and April  8 , Ponce de León waded  ashore  on the northeast  coast  of Florida , possibly  near presentday  St._Augustine .
Other  Europeans  may have reached  Florida  earlier , but no  firm  evidence  of such  achievement  has been found . 
French  settlement  of Florida  began  in 1562  as Huguenots , French  Protestants , established  themselves on the St._Johns_River  not  far  from the Spanish  settlement  at St._Augustine . 
Britain  gained  control  of Florida  in 1763  in exchange  for Havana , Cuba , which the British  had captured  from Spain  during the Seven Years’ War  (1756 –63 ). 
Spain  evacuated  Florida  after the exchange , leaving  the province  virtually  empty .
At that time , St._Augustine  was  still  a garrison  community  with fewer  than five_hundred  houses  and Pensacola  also  was  a small  military  town .
First , it was split  into two  parts : East  Florida , with its capital  at St._Augustine ; and West  Florida , with its seat  at Pensacola  and the Apalachicola_River  became  the boundary  between them.
The two  Floridas remained  loyal  to Great_Britain  throughout the War_of_American_Independence  (1776 83 ).
In 1783 , Spain  regained  control  of the rest  of Florida  as part  of the peace_treaty  that ended  the American_Revolution .
Americans  joined  the battles  for Florida  in 1803 , following  their purchase  of Louisiana  from the French .
The history  of Florida  during this period  is  one of territorial  gain  and loss  until 1821 , when Spain  ceded  Florida  to the United_States_of_America .
When the British  evacuated  Florida , Spanish  colonists  as well as settlers  from the newly  formed  United_States  came  pouring  in .
Many of the new  residents  were lured  by favorable  Spanish  terms  for acquiring  property , called  land_grants .
Instead  of becoming  more  Spanish , Florida  increasingly  became  more  "American ."
Finally , after several  official  and unofficial  U.S.  military_expeditions  into the territory , Spain  formally  ceded  Florida  to the 
United_States  in 1821 , according  to terms  of the AdamsOnís Treaty . 
What the U.S.  inherited  was  a wilderness  sparsely  dotted  with settlements  of native  Indian  people , African_Americans  and Spaniards .
As a territory  of the United_States , Florida  was particularly  attractive  to people  from the older  Southern  plantation  areas  of Virginia , the Carolinas  and Georgia , who arrived  in considerable  numbers .
After territorial  status  was granted , the two  Floridas were merged  into one  entity  with a new  capital  city  in Tallahassee .
As Florida ’s population  increased  through immigration , so  did pressure  on the federal_government  to remove  the Indian  people  from their lands .
The Indian  population  was made_up  of several  groups   primarily , the Creek  and the Miccosukee people  and many  African_American  refugees  lived  with the Indians .
The U.S.  government  spent  $20  million  and the lives  of many  U.S.  soldiers , Indian  people  and U.S.  citizens  to force  the removal  of the Seminoles .
Some  Indians  migrated  "voluntarily ." 
Some were captured  and sent  west  under military  guard ; and others escaped  into the Everglades , where they  made a life  for themselves away  from contact  with whites .
Beginning  in the 1870 s, residents  from northern  states  visited  Florida  as tourists  to enjoy  the state ’s natural  beauty  and mild  climate 
By the turn_of_the_century , Florida ’s population  and 
per_capita  wealth  were increasing  rapidly ; the potential  of the "Sunshine_State " appeared  endless .
One of the most  significant  trends  of the postwar  era  (1945 1960 ) has been  steady  population  growth , resulting  from large  migrations  to the state  from within the U.S.  and from countries  throughout the western_hemisphere , notably  Cuba  and Haiti . 
Since the 1950 s, Florida ’s public  education  system  and public  places  have undergone  great  changes .
African_American  citizens , joined  by Governor  LeRoy Collins and other  white  supporters , fought  to end  racial  discrimination  in schools  and other  institutions .
Today , Florida  attractions , such as the large  theme_parks  in the Orlando  area , bring  millions  of visitors  to the state  from across the U.S.  and around the world . 
Palmetto_State  (tree ),  Swamp State ,  Rice State , South_Carolina  was originally  named   in honor  of France  Charles_IX  and then  in honor  of England  Charles_I  and Charles_II .
National_Parks  & Monuments  in  South Carolina  include  Congaree Swamp , Fort  Moultrie and Fort  Sumter.
Following  the exploration  of the coast  in 1521  by Francisco de Gordillo, the Spanish  tried  unsuccessfully  to establish  a colony  near presentday  Georgetown  in 1526  and the French  also  failed  to colonize  Parris Island  near Fort  Royal in 1562 .
In colonial  days , the state  was  part  of a vast  region  that Charles_I , king_of_England , granted  to Sir  Robert Heath in 1629 .
The region  was named  Carolana, a word  derived  from the Latin  form  of Charles, in reference  to the monarch .
The first  English  settlement  was made  in 1670  at Albemarle Point  on the Ashley River , but poor  conditions  drove  the settlers  to the site  of Charleston  (originally  called  Charles Town).
South_Carolina , officially  separated  from 
North_Carolina  in 1729 , was  the scene  of extensive  military_action  during the revolution  and again  during the civil_war .
The civil_war  began  in 1861  as South_Carolina  troops  fired  on federal  Fort  Sumter in Charleston  Harbor  and the state  was  the first  to secede  from the Union .
Points  of interest  include  Fort  Sumter National_Monument , Fort  Moultrie, Fort  Johnson and aircraft_carrier  USS Yorktown in Charleston  Harbor ; the Middleton, Magnolia and Cypress Gardens  in Charleston ; Cowpens National  Battlefield ; the Hilton Head resorts ; and the Riverbanks 200  and botanical_garden  in Columbia .
Today , manufacturing  is  the state  largest  employer , based  largely  on resources  found  in South_Carolina .
Between 1820  and 1920  blacks  outnumbered  whites  in South_Carolina  but after 1920  the state  white  population  grew  more  rapidly  than the black  population  because many  blacks  migrated  to the North .
Blacks  are  still  a majority  in parts  of rural  South_Carolina , although many  blacks  have moved  to urban  areas .
Native_Hawaiians  and other   Pacific Islanders  numbered  1 ,628 
Hispanics , who may be  of any  race , were  2 .4  percent  of the population .
The Gem_State ,  Famous Potatoes , Idaho  was named  by George M. Willing, who unsuccessfully  sought  to become  a delegate  from what would become  the territory  of Colorado .
Prior  to the arrival  of European  and Mexican  explorers , roughly  8 ,000  Native_Americans  representing  two  distinct  groups  inhabited  Idaho    the Great Basin Shoshone and Bannock tribes  of the ShoshoneBannock and the Shoshone , Paiute  and the Plateau tribes  of the Coeur d’Alene, 
Nez_Perce  and Kootenai.
Today , Idaho ’s Native_American  heritage , their tribes  and their chiefs  are reflected  in county  names  like Nez Perce, Benewah Shoshone, Bannock and Kootenai counties  and the communities  of Shoshone, Pocatello , Blackfoot, Nezperce, White Bird, Kamiah, Lapwai, Weippe, Kooskia, Picabo and Tendoy.

It was  not  until the turn_of_the_century  that women  in more_than  a handful  of states  had  equal  right  to the family  assets  but In 1972 , Idaho  became  the first  state  in the nation  to ratify  the Equal Rights Amendment .
In 1805 , York, an AfricanAmerican  servant  for the  
Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition  traveled  through what is  now  Idaho .
Respected  by the Indians , York today  is credited  as being  of great  value  to the success  of the trip .
Some of the fur  trappers , traders  and miners  who followed  were  AfricanAmerican , including  one who helped  build  the first  mission in the Northwest .
Even the impact  of Hawaiian  Islanders  employed  as laborers  in the Northwest  fur  trade  received  recognition  through the naming  of Owyhee County .
Mountain_men , including  some  Spaniards  and Mexicans , lived  off the land  as trappers  and hunters .
Jesus Urquirdes, one of the several  successful  Mexican  business_people , came  to Boise  in 1863 , became  a prominent  Pacific_Northwest  packer  and built  the Spanish  Village  in 1870 s to house  his Mexican  packers .
Until after the Civil_War , only  free  Blacks  or escaped  slaves  came  West  unless brought  by their owners .
The entry  of the railroad  through southern  Idaho  starting  in the 1880 s resulted  in a number  of AfricanAmericans  settling  in Pocatello .
Four  companies  of troops  from the 
24 th  Regiment  (an African_American  unit ) were sent  to Idaho  in 1899  to maintain  order  during the Coeur d’Alene mining  strikes .

English  colonists , sent  by Sir_Walter_Raleigh , unsuccessfully  attempted  to settle  Roanoke Island  in 1585  and 1587 .
In 1653  the first  permanent  settlements  were established  by English  colonists  from Virginia  near the Roanoke and Chowan rivers .
The region  was established  as an English  proprietary_colony  in 1663 1665  and in its early  history  was  the scene  of Culpepper's Rebellion  (1677 ), the Quaker led  Cary Rebellion  (1708 ), the Tuscarora Indian War  (1711 1713 ) and many  pirate  raids .
During the American_Revolution , there was  relatively  little  fighting  within the state , but many  North_Carolinians  saw  action  elsewhere .
Despite considerable  pro Union , anti slavery  sentiment , North_Carolina  joined  the Confederacy  during the Civil_War .
North_Carolina  became  the 12 th  state  to unite  under America  on November  21 , 1789 .
 ScotsIrish , Highland_Scots , Germans  and Welsh  also  arrived  in the 18 th  century , many from the colony  of Pennsylvania .
Sometimes  certain  dialects  and accents  can be detected  in the speech  of more  isolated  rural  North_Carolinians , especially  on the  Outer Banks , where descendants  of early  English  settlers  remained  spatially  isolated  for many  decades .
North_Carolina  had  about  100 ,000  black  inhabitants  in 1790 , and by the time  of the American_Civil_War  (1861 1865 ) blacks  accounted for onethird  of the population .
