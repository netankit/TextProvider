Kashmir  is  perhaps , to possess  an authentic  account  of its history  from the very  earliest  period .
This past  account  of the valley , its culture  and traditions , rise  and fall  of various  Kingdoms , victory  and defeats  of the people  have been noted  carefully , yet  critically  by the sons  of its soil .
True  it is  that the Kashmiri at literature  is  very  rich  in information  about Kashmir.
The modern  state  of Jammu and Kashmir covered  an area  of 86024  square_miles  (prior  to 1947 ) extending  from 32 deg 78 ' to 36 deg 58 ' N  and from 73 deg 27 ' to 80 deg 72 ' E .
The entire  state  included , beside the Jammu region , Ladakh, Gilgit, Hunza, Nagar, Punial, and Yasin.
The tiny  state  of Chitral, located  towards the northwestern  side  of Gilgit, used  to pay  tribute  to Kashmir  ruler .
It was  due_to  the untiring  efforts  of Maharaja  Gulab Singh Ji (the founder  of Dogra Hindu  dynasty  in Kashmir) that the State  took  its present  shape  and form  in the 2 nd  half  of the 19 th  century .
The beauty  and the salubrious  climate  of the valley  were  known  even  from the ancient  times .
The mythological  traditions  supported  fully  by the research  of geologists  confirm  that the valley  originally  was  a huge  lake  called  "Satisar", ( the land  of goddess  Sati,  consort  of  Lord  Shiva  ) and its waters  were blocked  near Baramulla (ancient  Varahmulla).
In the words  of Sir  Francis Young Husband, "The huge  lake  must have been  twice  the length  and three  times  the width  of the lake  of Geneva , completely  encircled  by snowy  mountains  as  high , and higher  than Mount  Blank, while in the immediately  following  glacial  period , mighty  glaciers  came  wending  down  to the Sindh, Lidder, and other  valleys  even  to the edge  of water ."
Kashmir greatest  historian  Kalhan writes  about his native_land : "It is  a country  where the sun  shines  mildly , being  the place  created  by Rishi Kashyap, for his glory   big  and lofty  houses , learning , saffron , icy  cool  water  and grapes  rare  in Heaven  are  plentiful  here   Kailash is  the best  place  in the three  worlds  (Trilok), Himalayas  the best  place  in Kailash, and Kashmir the best  place  in Himalayas ".
Sir  Walter Lawrence writes  "The valley  is  an emerald  set  in pearls ; a land  of lakes , clear  streams , green  turf , magnificent  trees  and mighty  mountains  where the air  is  cool , and the water  sweet , where men  are  strong , and women  vie  with the soil  in fruitfulness .
He further  writes  that the valley  contains  everything which should make  life  enjoyable .
There is  sport  varied  and excellent ; there is  scenery  for the artist  and the layman , mountain  for the mountaineer , flower  for the botanist , a vast  field  for the geologist  and magnificent  ruins  for the archaeologist .
According  to the oldest  extant  book  on Kashmir, “Nilmat Puran ", in the Satisar lived  a  demon  called  Jalod Bowa, who tortured  and devoured  the people , who lived  near mountain  slopes .
Hearing  the suffering  of the people , a great  saint  of our country , Kashyap by name , came  to the rescue  of the people  here .
After performing  penance  for a long  time , the saint  was  blessed , and he was_able_to  cut  the mountain  near Varahmulla, which blocked  the water  of the lake  from flowing  into the plains  below .
The lake  was  drained , the land  appeared , and the  demon  was killed .
The saint  encouraged  people  from India  to settle  in the valley .
The people  named  the valley  as KashyapMar and KashyapPura.
The name  Kashmir also  implies  land  desiccated  from water : "ka" (the water ) and shimeera (to desiccate ).
The ancient  Greeks  called  it "Kasperia" and the Chinese  pilgrim  HienTsang who visited  the valley  around  631  A.D.  called  it KaShiMiLo ".
In modern  times  the people  of Kashmir have shortened  it into "Kasheer" in their tongue .
The chief  Geological_formation  of the iceage  here  are  the latchstring deposits  called  the " Karewas ", which overlay  the terminal  moraines  of the first  Glaciation  and are comprised  of two  groups , Lower  and Upper , differentiated  by the moraines  of the second  Glaciation .
The fossil  remains  of ElphasHysudrious obtained  in the lower  'Karewas' point  to lower “Pleistocene  age  ", writes  De Teera.
The Neolithic  culture  is indicated  by the discovery  of ground  and polished  stone  axes , hoes , pestle , and bone  implements  at the wellknown  menhir site  of Burzahom, ten  miles  east  of, Srinagar.
Burazahoma is  famous  as one of the only  two  megalithic  sites  in the extreme  northwest  of Indian  subcontinent .
We do not  exactly  know  the Cultural  horizon  of the Burazahoma megalithic, nor the Purpose  for which they were erected , but the indications  are , they were put  in places  towards the end  of the Neolithic  period  at that site , between 400  to 300  B.C. "
In 1960 , Archaeological  Department  of the Government  of India  began  systematic  excavation  at this site .
This is  perhaps  the only  known  find  of such a settlement  in India .
It is  possible  that more  valuable  data  would be found , when extensive  surface  diggings  are completed .
Kalhan has started  the history  of Kashmir just  before the great  Mahabharat war , and the first  King  mentioned  by him is  Gonanda I, whose initial  year  of reign  he places  in 653  Kaliera , the traditional  date  of the coronation  of King  Yudhistira, the eldest  brother  of the Pandvas.
Gonanda was killed  in a battle  along  with his son  in India , and at the time  of the commencement  of the Mahabharat war , Gonanda II was ruling  Kashmir .
After his death , the great  historian  informs  that the record  of 35  kings  who ruled  the valley  could not  be traced  by him, because of the destruction  of the record .
However  a modern  scholar  Peer Zada Hassan has given  a brief  record  of these Kings  from a Persian  work  composed  during the time  of Sultan  ZainulAbdeen (1420 70 ).
The author  of this work  Mulla Ahmad had been  able  to obtain  the names  of these kings  from an earlier  Sanskrit  work  “Ratnakar ".
The great  Mauryan emperor  Ashoka is recorded  to have ruled  Kashmir, and Kalhan rightly  mentions  that the king  was a follower  of Buddhism .
Ashoka founded  the old  city  of Srinagar called  now  as “Pandrethan ", (Puranadhisthan) and also  build  many  vihars and temples  and repaired  the old  shrine .
At Vijeshwari (modern  Bijbehra), he built  a Shiva  Temple , thus winning  the heart  of the local  population , who were  mostly  worshippers  of  Lord  Shiva .
It was  Majjhantika, a celebrated  Buddhist  missionary  who was deputed  to Kashmir and Urvasa to preach  the faith  of Buddha  in those territories .
HienTsang mentions  the arrival  of 500  monks  to Kashmir, and Ashoka making  a gift  of the valley  to Sangha.
Many  Buddhist  scholars , missionaries , and intellectuals  permanently  settled  in the valley .
Naturally , in the course of time, many  people  embraced  Buddhism  here .
According  to local  tradition , like  Lord  Shri Krishna ,  Lord  Buddha  is  also  supposed  to have visited  Kashmir.
Writes  Sir  Charles Elliot in a book  called  'Hinduism and Buddhism': "For some  two  centuries  after Gautam's death , we have  little  information  as to the geographical  extension  of his doctrine , but some of the Sanskrit  versions  of the “Vinaya ", represent  him visiting  Mathura, northwest  India  and Kashmir .
After the death  of Ashoka, his son  Jaluka ascended  the throne  of Kashmir , and the latter  was succeeded  by his son  King  Damodar II.
King  Damodar lives  in our memory  even  at present , for the Srinagar Airport  is  located  at Damodar I Karewa ', where the king  is  supposed  to have lived  in a big  palace  and, where again , he was transformed  into a snake  by the curse  of a Brahmin .
The scholars  also , accept  the theory  that the valley  for over two_hundred  years  was ruled  by  IndoGreek  Kings  before the start  of “Turushka “(Kushan) rule  in the state .
Cunningham records  a large  find  of silver  coins  of Azes (and Azilies) (coins  of  IndoScythians ) on the banks  of Vitasta (river  Jhelum) in the hills  between Varahmulla and Jhelum.
The contact  with the Greeks  is  responsible  for the beautiful  architectural  and sculptural  style  of old  Kashmir  temples , and the coinage  of later  Kashmir  Kings  has also  been influenced  by this contact .
Kalhan's account  of Turushka Kings  indicates  without any  doubt  the Kushan occupation  of the Valley .
The three  kings  mentioned  by him are  Huska, Juska, and Kanishka, each of them is  credited  with the foundation  of a town , after their respective  names : Hushkapura, Jushkapura and Kanishkapura.
The Kushan Kings  also  built  many  temples  and Vihars.
The entire  proceedings  of the conference  were inscribed  on copper  plates  in Sanskrit , enclosed  in stone  boxes , deposited  in a Vihar.
Like famous  Gilgit manuscripts , it is  possible  that these copper  plates  may be unearthed  in near  future , and we would learn  much  about the rich  cultural  history  of the valley .
As a result  of this conference , large  number  of Kashmiri  intellectuals  took_to  missionary  work  and hundreds  of the wisest  sons  of the valley  carried  the torch of Indian  civilization  and culture  to many  parts  of Central  Asia , China , Tibet  and other  places .
The number  of Buddhist  scholars  who went  to China  from Kashmir  is  larger  than that of those who went  from other  parts  of India .
Kashmir  was  the most  flourishing  centre  of Buddhist  learning  in this period .
It was  the centre  of most  powerful  Buddhist  sect  of Northern  India  known_as  'Sarvastivada'.
A few of the most  important  Kashmir  Missionaries  were  Kumarjiva, Yasa, Vima Laksha, Sanghbuti, Gautam Sangha, Buddviyasa, Buddhijiva, Gunavarman, Dharamputra and Shyama Bhata.
After Kanishka, local  weak  rulers  continued  to govern  the state , till we hear  from Kalhan, the arrival  of MahirGul, the notorious  Hun  invader  of our country .
Kalhan correctly  represents  him as a savage  cruel  king , whose approach  became  known  by the sight  of thousands  of vultures , crows  and the like  in the sky , eager  to feed  on those being massacred  by his encircling  army .
Till the advent  of Karkota dynasty  (beginning  of 8 th  Century ) the Gonanda dynasty  gave  Kashmir  only  two  notable  rulers  viz.  Meghvahan and Pravansein.
The former  was  a pious  and a strong  ruler  with Buddhist  leanings .
He stopped  killing  of animals  and birds  throughout his Kingdom .
In_fact , he undertook  conquest  of many  countries  solely  for the purpose  of stopping  animal  slaughter .
His chief  queen  Amrit Prabha built  'Amrit Bhawan' Vihar for foreign  pilgrims  and students  who came  to Kashmir  in large  numbers  for learning .
