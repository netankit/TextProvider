Arunachal's charms  are  many , and lie  in its wideopen  spaces  and changing  topography .
 :2 :  :2 : From mountains  and plains  to lush  tea  gardens  and forests , a fascinating  tribal  culture  rich  in music , food  and dance , this is a state  where you will learn  some of life  most  important  lessons  while on holiday . 
 :3 :  :3 : Even  a week  would not  be enough  to fully  experience  the beauty  and sheer  variety  of all that Arunachal has to offer . 
 :4 :  :4 : I am sure  that the memories  that you carry  back  from Arunachal will be  truly  special .
 :5 :  :5 : A short  drive  from the airport  in Itanagar, Donyi Polo Ahoke can be confidently  called  the best  accommodation  option  in the whole  of Arunachal Pradesh in the conventional  sense . 
 :7 :  :7 : Don't get  carried_away  by its grand  status  of being  the only   five star  hotel  in the state  though ; this is  a simple  place  that offers  comfortable  wellappointed  rooms , a   multi  cuisine  restaurant  that offers  well prepared  but generic  fare , and sprawling  lawns  complete  with a jogging  track  where you can enjoy  the surrounding  greens .
 :8 :  :8 : The biggest  draw  of Arunachal Pradesh is  its  unspoilt  landscape  and at Patasali, an  ecofriendly  camp  run  by the forest  department , you have  the chance  to enjoy  it at its best 
 :9 :  :9 : Located  inside  Nameri Sanctuary , on the border  of Arunachal and Assam , this camp  may not offer  top  end  luxury  but the silence  of the forest  and the abundant  greenery  will more than make_up  for it.
 :10 :  :10 : You can spend  your time  river  rafting  or fishing  both  activities  can be arranged  by the camp .
 :11 :  :11 : With more  tourists  flowing  in, villagers  have  wisened up  and you can now  find   paying  guest  accommodation  in many  villages .
 :12 :  :12 : If you want  a close  encounter  with authentic  tribal  life , then snap_up  the first  opportunity .
 :13 :  :13 : A word  of caution :   before  opting  to stay  with any  one of the tribes  here , do read  up on culture  to be  cognisant  of local  etiquette  and aware  of sensitive  issues . 
 :14 :  :14 : Forest  rest_house , Deban village , located  in  lap  of the forested  Patkai hills  and on the banks  of the Noadihing river , beauty  halts  at this riverside  hotel .
 :15 :  :15 : Wake_up  to the call  of the macaque  and spend  your hours  chasing  the elusive  
 hoolock gibbon , an endangered  species  of the ape  that is only  found  in the northeast .
 :17 : Find  yourself a hut  at the Model Village  in Ziro, which replicates  a typical  Arunachal village  environment . 
The huts  are beautifully  decorated , and surprisingly , are  equipped  with modern  amenities .
 :18 :  :18 :  :17 : If you are  the adventurous  sort , you can try  the local  tribal  dishes , but if not , you can have  regular  simple  north  Indian  fare 
 :19 : A rare  chance  to experience  tribal  Arunachal lifestyle  without having  to roughing it out .
 :20 :  :19 :  :18 : If inadvertently , you happen  to walk  into the remotest  areas  of the state  without hotel  bookings , and are  on the verge  of a 
nervous_breakdown , here  is  a ready  solution .
 :22 :  :20 : Ask  the  locals  about the PWD inspection  bungalows  or circuit  houses . 
 :23 : You will find  one  everywhere  and most  are  safe  and clean  options ; sometimes  these modest  rest_houses  can surprise  you with their good  food  and decor . 
 :24 :  :22 : Keep your expectations  low  (you did not  bother  to make  reservations , remember ?), strike_up  a conversation  with the caretaker  and make  your holiday  even  more  memorable .
 :25 :  :23 : In a state  where bamboo  is found  in such  abundance , it is not  surprising  that bamboo_shoot  finds its way into most  food  preparations . 
 :26 :  :24 : Perhaps  the most  easily  available  of these is  like, a combination  of bamboo_shoots , fish  and dried  chillies  (a common  ingredient  in most  dishes  in Arunachal, chillies  are dried  and pounded  and kept  for use  throughout the year ). 
 :27 :  :25 : Iku is had  in all  sorts  of possible  ways  dry , boiled  and made  into a broth  and even  pickled . 
 :28 :  :26 : Prepared  to be  alarmed  (and, later , to alarm  others) before you swig  away  mugs  of apong.  
 :29 :  :27 : This local  rice_beer  is  quite  a  killer , both  in taste  and effect .
 :30 :  :28 : Unlike  most  beers , this one is not  had  chilled  but, in_fact , served  warm . 
 :31 :  :29 : Traditionally , apong is had  in large   quirkily  decorated  bamboo  mugs , which also  doubles  as good  keepsakes . 
 :32 :  :30 : You can get  the taste  of apong easily  if you ask  any   local , but the capital  Itanagar is  perhaps  your best   bet .
 :33 :  :31 : A staple  of the Apatani tribe , pike pila is  the main  dish  made  out of assorted  vegetables  and pork .
 :34 :  :32 : If you are wondering , what's so  special  about that  veggies  and pork  is  of_course  a common  mix  found  all_over  the northeast   the difference  here  is  in the manner  of preparation . 
 :35 :  :33 : The vegetables  and meat  are mixed  in an earthen  pot , which is then  buried  for three  days 
 :36 : As a result  of this natural  cooking , (we resist  the word  decay ), the ingredients  turn  into a thick  paste  and a delicacy  that the  tribals  are  immensely  fond  of!
 :37 :  :35 :  :34 : At 13 ,700  ft , it is  one of the highest  restaurants  in the world . 
 :38 : The one  room  cabin  that goes  by the name  of Tenzing Restaurant  is  also  the long  dwelling  at Sela Pass , the entry  point  to Tawang district  where everyone stops . 
 :39 :  :36 :  :35 : This place  is more about sights  than slurps   you won’t find  too  many  traditional  dishes , but you can get  well  prepared  soup , alongwith fluffy  omelettes  and charcoal  toasted  bread .
 :40 :  :36 : The many  festivals  of Arunachal are  the best  time  to taste  traditional , and sometimes  rare , tribal  cuisine . 
 :41 :  :37 : The Loser festival  held  in February /March  marks  the beginning  of the lunar  new_year  according  to the Monpa calendar  and this is  the ideal  time  to sample  the best  of the local  food , which chiefly  consists  of momos, thukpas, pork  preparations  and soups . 
 :42 :  :38 : It also  happens  to be  the most  commonly  known  and popular  Arunachali food , and something  that doesn’t require  you to be  brave  to try  it.
 :43 :  :39 : If you want  slightly  less  known  Monapa food , try  chhurpi, a type  of yak  cheese  mainly  used  to thicken  curries .
 :44 :  :40 : If you find  people  making  rotis for dinner , you are  definitely  not  in Arunachal Pradesh. 
 :45 :  :41 : Rice  is eaten  at all  meal  times  here , so  there is  no  escaping  it. 
 :46 :  :42 : What we are talking  about is  the special  white_rice  particular  to Lohit district , which has  its own  special  flavour  and fragrance .
 :47 :  :43 : Cooked  on bamboo , this is  typically  had  with pork  or bamboo_shoot , or both.
 :48 :  :44 : Most of the local  jewellery  is primarily  made of beads .
 :49 :  :45 : However , hunt  for braided  jewellery  embellished  with unusual  additions  such as bird  feathers  and even  wings  of beetles .
 :50 :  :46 : It is  always  a good  idea  to bring_back  more_than  just  photographs  to remind  you of a destination , but in Arunachal Pradesh it would be  downright  silly  to come_back  without one of the special  Monpa carpets   beautifully  handwoven , these are found  with dragon  motifs , or with bright , colourful  geometric  and floral  designs . 
 :52 :  :48 : Sure  to be  your neighbour  envy .
 :53 :  :49 : The different  tribes  here  use  timber  from sal, teak , and oak  to make  plates , bowls , cups , and toys , which are  quite  charming  in their simplicity . 
 :54 :  :50 : You can also  hunt  for the more  exotic  wooden  curios : carved  and painted  masks , miniature  figurines , intricately  carved  Buddha  idols  and statues  of warriors  in action  are  just  few of the things  you should pick_up . 
 :55 : It may not  be  the same  quality  as  the beautifully  packaged  handmade  paper  one  finds in Pondicherry, but the handmade  paper  the  tribals  churn_out  is  definitely  worth  its weight  in paper_currency . 
 :56 :  :52 : A must   pickup  is  the variety  made  from the bark  of the Daphne  Botanica tree , by the Apatanis in Ziro. 
 :57 :  :53 : The Sherdudpen, Khampa and Monpa tribes  make  beautiful  masks  carved  out of a single  block  of wood . 
 :58 :  :54 : Take  your pick  from interesting  pieces  depicting  human  emotions , birds  and animals .
 :59 :  :55 : Some  masks  look  terrifying , which means  you have one that is attempting  to scare_away  evil_spirits .
 :60 :  :56 : Some are  charming  and pleasing  to look_at  these invite  prosperity  and good  times .
 :61 :  :57 : Though beautiful  and colourful  woven   goodies  are  widely  available  in Arunachal, each  tribe  has  its own  speciality . 
 :62 :  :58 : From the Sherdukpens, for_instance , you must buy  shawls ; and from the Apatanis, jackets  and bags ; the Wanchos are  good  with bags  too . 
 :63 :  :59 : To the typical  tourist , Thangka cloth  paintings  are  nothing  more_than  great  looking  wall_hangings . 
 :64 :  :60 : But the art  connoisseur  knows  the value  of a handmade  thangka, a rare  and expensive  treasure .
 :65 :  :61 : Laden  with religious  significance , thangka portray  the life  and work  of the Buddha . 
 :66 :  :62 : The ones you  should especially  try  and find  are  those that elaborate  on the many  parables  the Buddha  recounted  to his followers  and disciples .  
 :67 :  :63 : The cloth  on which thangka are painted  is ‘purified ’ with prayers ; in the past , the paint  used  was made  by grinding  precious  stones , and the paintings  itself was done  only  by designated , learned  monks  or highranking  artists . 
 :69 :  :65 : Thangkas are  supposed  to drive_away  evil  and herald  peace  and prosperity . 
 :70 :  :66 : Nestled  in the eastern  Himalayan  region , identified  as one of the major  biodiversity  hotspots  of the world , Assam  is a beautiful  land  of lush  deciduous  forests  and serpentine  rivers .
 :71 :  :67 : With five  important  National_Parks , of which Kanziranga and Manas have been listed  as World  Heritage  Sites , and 17  wildlife  sanctuaries , this is  a nature  lover  paradise .
 :72 : The mighty  Brahmaputra  flows  through the state , bringing  life  to the verdant  floodplains  and grasslands .
 :73 :  :69 : And it is  the state  rich  biodiversity  that makes it the only  producer  of four  types  of silk   the golden  muga, the white  pat, the warm  eri and lovely  tussar.
 :74 :  :70 : Visit  the silk  town  of Sualkuchi and you’ll hear  the rhythm  of shuttles  weaving  the most  exquisite  silks  and cottons .
 :75 :  :71 : Do make  a trip  to the Kamakhya Temple , a beautiful  and venerated  site  of Shakti  shrines , where history  breathes  through stones . 
 :76 :  :72 : The state  has  a large  number  of tribes , whose variety  of traditions , customs  and dress  reflect  the vibrant  multicultural  tapestry  that is  Assam .

 :80 :  :76 :  Large  private  rooms  look  out over  gardens  verging  on the wild  and thick  bamboo  groves .

 :86 :  :82 : They have now started  a safari  route  that begins  from Ghorakate and winds  through the less  explored  areas  of the park .
 :87 :  :83 : For a completely  and enchantingly  different  experience  from staying  in hotels  and resorts , head  to Majuli, the largest  river  island  in the world . 
 :88 :  :84 : In its dreamy ,  unspoilt  surrounds , you will find  the Satras that it is  so  famous  for.
