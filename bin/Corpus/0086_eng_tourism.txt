Karnataka  is  the meeting  point  of traditional  and modern  India .
I feel  any  journey  to India  should begin  from Bengalooru (formerly  Bangalore ) or Mysore . 
 :2 : The state  offers  a whole  bouquet  of experience  for tourists : just  place  a finger  anywhere  on state ’s map  and you will find  a place  of interest .
Nowadays , I don’t get  enough  time  to do  what I like  best  – revisiting  the monuments  of Karnataka .
My all_time  favourite  is  the Gol Gumbaj at Bijapur; I really  love  the sight  of its massive  dome  touching  the sky .
The list  is  never_ending  – the World  Heritage  Site  at Hampi, the magnificent  St. Aloysius church  in coastal  Mangalore, the beautiful  flora  and fauna  at Bandipur National_Park , the BR Hills  Sanctuary , enchanting  Coorg, or the imposing  fortress  at Srirangapatna.
One can also  be  awed  by the Ibrahim Roza, a mosque  and tomb  said  to have inspired  the making  of the Taj_Mahal .
I think  the Heritage  site  at Hampi, Pattadakal, Belur, Halebid and many  others rival  the beauty  of the 
Taj_Mahal .
So, don’t come_out  to Karnataka  with just  a week  in_hand ; come  and stay  longer , wander  off the beaten  track  and discover  all that the state  has  to offer . 
 Wake_up  to the chirping  of birds , enjoy  a relaxing  massage  and let  the lapping  of waves  lull  you to sleep . 
You don’t have to be  an angler  to enjoy  the scenic  woody  stretch  along the mighty  Cauvery, on which the Jungle  lodge  is  located , but if you are , you’ll be  doubly  delighted .
The resort , which consists  of luxurious  log  huts  on stilts  and tented  cottages , has  a forest  as a  backdrop .
The Jungle  lodge  overlooks  the river , teeming  with carp , catfish  and famously , the Mahaseer.
The best  time  to be  at Bheemeshwari is , between November  and February .
The guests  at the Jungle  lodge  at Bheemeshwari, are also  provided  with a local  guide  or ‘gillie ’ who is  adept  with the coracles  and can help  the beginners  to make a catch. 
For a unique  slice  of nature , spend  a few  days  here  at Bheemeshwari Jungle  lodge .
Swaswara resort , perched  on a cliff  overlooking  Gokarna’s Om Beach , is  a resting  place  for the mind .
The Konkan  style  Villas  are tucked  away  in the greenery , with only  the  lapping  of the waves  and birdsong  breaking  the silence . 
The Swaswara resort  also  has  an Ayurvedic centre  and Yoga  and meditation  facilities .
Nourishment  for the body  is  as  tempting  as that for the soul  – with a selection  of fresh  seafood , prepared  with the produce  from the area ’s farms . 
Shreyas retreat : this boutique yoga  retreat  combines  ashram   style  life  with  five star  luxuries .
Choose  from Sheryas retreat ’s yoga  and wellness  packages to discover  the ‘all_round  excellence ’ or ‘Shreyas’ inherent  within you and draw  on the expertise  of the instructor  who conducts  these workshops .
These yoga  exercises  are  recommended  for the severely  stressed  out.
At 3000  feet  above the sea_level , in the Bababudangiri hills  of Chilmanglur, you defiantly  are  a little  closer  to Nirvana .
Chose  your pleasure  and your place  at this charming  plantation   getaway  – trek , go  on a coracle  ride , go   birding , explore  the nature  trail  and   wind down  with the delicious  barbecue  under the stars  before retiring  to your cosy  colonial  bungalow  for the night .
The area  called  as Nirvana has  a few  intriguing  attractions ; the Bababundagiri  cave , once  the abode  of the Sufi  saint  Hazrat Dada Hayat Mir Kalander; the Mulangiri peak , the highest  in the state , and if you are  lucky , you’ll see  corvia, a mountain  flower  that blooms  once  every  14  years . 
The Schools–Estate is  a 80  – year  old  estate  in Coorg, once  home  to one of the districts ’ missionaries , is  enormous , old_fashioned  and very  cosy .
Surrounded  by tea , coffee  and vanilla  plantations , explore  the many  walking  trails  leading  into the hills  around .
Try  your hand  at golf  or learn  a few  Coorgi cooking   tips  from Rani  Aiyapa, known  far_and_wide  for her delicious  dishes .
Snuggle  up under a hand_stitched  quilt  with a book  or just  sit  under the large  
mango_tree  and get away from it all.
Villa  Pottipati , a 133  – year  old  bungalow  surrounded  by fruit , jacaranda  and gulmohar trees  in old  Bangalore ’s Brahmin  stronghold of Malleswaram, has watched  the decades  go_by  almost  unmoved .
The Villa  of red  cement  floors , teakwood  beams  and antique  rosewood  furniture  is  probably  the most  authentic  heritage  experience  this city  of steel  and glass  offers  you.
Each  guest_room  is  different  – the spacious  Venkatagiri suite  has  a verandah  and a private  dressing  area ; the Rajadurga Suite  rewards  early  wakers  with a spectacular  sunrise  and the Kanchipuram suite  has  it’s own  pillared  balcony , an old_fashioned   limegreen  bathroom  and antique  gramophone .
Set  amidst the 300  acres  of coffee  and spice  plantation , the Orange County is  a good  place  to begin  to experience  the hospitality  of Coorg.
Take  a spice  tour  to learn  how coffee  and spices  are cultivated , go  boating  or fishing , or to be infused  with new  life , step  into Vaidyasala in the ayurveda  village  and let  the 5 ,000  – year  old  secrets  of India ’s holistic  medical  system  rejuvenate  you.
Hand yourself over to masseurs , herbal  baths  and conditioning  treatments  and leave  with a glow  and new  vigor .
None other than British  design   icon  Terence Conran transformed  this four  – storeyed  low  – budget  hotel ,The Park, into one of India ’s best   designer  hotel .
The Park has  one of the most  colorful  yet  classy  interiors  that you will come_across .
There are  splashes  of orange , lime, 
burnt  amber  orange  and deep  purple  all  around .
Even  the elevators  are done_up  in leather  while each  floor  has  it’s own  theme ; the hotel  also  boasts  of ibar, Bangalore ’s first  lounge  bar .
The Park’s new  addition , Aqua, is  the haunt  for the city ’s  hip ‘n’ happening , so, come  and enjoy  your martinis  and cognac  by the temperature   controlled  pool .
Experience  the nature ’s healing  touch  at this garden  retreat ,Angsana Oasis resort  and spa , a few  hours  from Bangalore .

With an aerobics  centre , yoga  and meditation  rooms , squash  and tennis  courts , there are  plenty  of fitness  options  at Angsana Oasis resort  and spa .
Earlier  this year , Tata Coffee entered  the hospitality  sector  with a cluster  of holiday  homes  – colonial  plantation  bungalows  – around Coorg.
Located  on estates  earlier  occupied  by the planters  of Tata Coffee, these  atmospheric  bungalows  have been redone  beautifully .
Take  a jeep  ride  through the vast  plantations , visit  the cardamom  kiln , go  on a bird  watching  expedition  or try  your hand  at a round_of_golf  at the company ’s golf_course , while you’re there .
I recommend  the Taj West End, Bangalore , for a comfortable  stay ; also  its jogging  track  is  especially  good .
There are  small  hotels  in Hampi that I find  very  charming  while the Bandipur Wildlife  Resort  is  also  another  favorite , what with the dense  forests  as a backdrop.
It’s a land  of seafood  lovers , thanks  to a rich  coastal  cuisine . 
For small  eaters , there are  platters  of mouth_watering  snacks .
 :53 : Windsor pub , located  off Miller Road  in Bangalore , is  this delightfully  authentic  little  pub .
The walls  are  jam_packed  with posters  and pop_arts , complementing  the lovely  (art) dark  wood  everywhere .
The cold  beers  help  wash_down  a large  variety  of offerings , from the filling  Sunday  Pub  lunch  to the chicken  cutlets  or masala prawns .
The menu  at Windsor pub  is  primarily  coastal , with limited  but skillfully  made  continental  dishes .
The place  is  crowded  on most  evenings , especially  weekends , and a patient  wait  is suitably  rewarded .
Taj Mahal for_short , this popular  Mangalore restaurant  has  two  branches , be  careful  it’s probably  a sin  to not  finish_off  every  meal  with the Taj Mahal special  coffee . 
Most  city  folks  recommend  the addictive  tuppa (ghee ) dosa, which melt  like well, butter  in one’s mouth , served  with their own  unique  chutney .
Another  delicacy  of the New Taj Mahal Cafe  is  the bibbeupkari (tender  cashews  plucked  before they become  nuts  and made  with grated  coconut  spices pieces), which is  the seasonal  offerings .
Dosas: why dosas, you must be wondering 
Isn’t that Tamil_Nadu’ s culinary  gem ? 
Well, contrary  to popular  notion  Karnataka  makes  some of the best  dosas.
 :62 : In Bangalore , MTR may be  the best_known  dosa place , but many refer  Vidyarthi Bhawan.
 :63 : Tucked  away in the crowded  streets  of Gandhi Bazaar , Vidyarthi Bhawan has served  its loyal  patrons  since 1938 .
One can see  Vidyarthi Bhawan’s hyperactive  waiters  balancing  as  many  as 15  plates  of dosa at any  time .
The Mysore masala dosa, the default  order , unless you catch  the waiter’s  attention  long  enough  to choose ) is  arguably  the best  in town , with its crispy  sides , dollop  of butter  and delectable  coconut  chutney .
Located  on the banks  of the Tungabhadra, the delightfully  rustic  Mango Tree serves  the best  meals  (Thalis) in Hampi.
The setting  at the Mango Tree is  the backyard  of a traditional  home , under a massive  mango_tree  with a swing .
The meals  are served  by the owner , Krishna, and his family , on low  tables , while one sits  on the ground  on the straw  mats .
The Mango Tree 's  special  thali is  the single  best  idea  here  – don’t bother  with the rest  of the menu , just  order  the banana  coconut  lassi.
This Mango Tree restaurant  is  just  15  minutes  away  from the Hampi Bazaar .
Kamat lokaruchi is  the most  popular  rest_stop  for anyone traveling  the Bangalore  – Mysore  stretch .
Kamat Lokaruchi : this vegetarian   eatery  is said  to best  represent  the cuisine  of the state  (apart from the coasts ) across all  three  meals .
The usual  South  Indian  staples  apart , the breakfast  menu  includes  the akki roti, malnad kadubu (Pyramid  shaped  Idlis wrapped  in coconut  leaf ), raagi dosa and avalakki (beaten  rice ), some or all of which comprises  a superlative  meal .
The best  choices  for lunch  are  the jowar roti and the raagi mudde (raagi ball) meals , unique  to the southern  districts .
The Lalitha Mahal Palace Restaurant  gives  you the best  feel  of the royalty  Mysore  has been home  to for generations .
The restaurant  is housed  in the erstwhile  ballrooms  of the Mysore Palace , with a sky  high  Baroque  ceiling  with domed  sky_lights  and white  Wedgwood  decor .  
The thalis are  among the most  enjoyable  choices , apart from the Manglore fish  curry  and lasooni malai tikka. 
The purpose , primarily , is  to dine  like a king .
Any  Bangalorean, who has been away  from home , will undoubtedly  crave  the desserts  at the city’s  unique  icecream  shop , The Corner House, which has now  spread  to multiple  branches  beyond the initial  one on the Residency Road .
They will also  know  what you mean  when you say  DBC, the popular  acronym  for death  by chocolate , which is  probably  the flagship  dessert  at The Corner House.
Other  favourites  include  the seasonal  strawberries  with cream  and ice–cream  and the mint  chocolate_fudge .
Take_in  the pictures  of old  Bangalore  on the walls  till they put  the order  together .
Mangalore Pearl: a delicious  fusion  of the Konkani and coastal  food  in the state  has peppered the streets  of Karnataka  with places  where you can feast  on the seafood  as well as meat  preparations .
The menu  at Mangalore Pearl offers  a stunning  choice , ranging  from fish  curried  and fried  to some  superlative  mussels  and clam  dishes .
Chicken , mutton  and pork  options  are  present  in abundance  too . 
Try  the mutton  potraday (wrapped  in leaves  and cooked  in thick  coconut  gravy ), the rava fried  seer fish  (not  on the menu ) and the ponpallas.
The Sol Kadi is  a perfect  beverage  accompaniment , as is  the Kokum juice .
Koshy’s in Bangalore , along with its richer  cousin  Jewel Box,  is  a remnant  of the old  Bangalore .
The quaint  decor , along with the slow  waiters  and the eternally  old  menu , make  Koshy’s  the place  to be  on most  evenings .
Koshy’s has  something  for everyone   from families  gorging  on the famous  Sunday  breakfast  of appam and stew  and the elderly  Bangaloreans having  their continental  lunch   to the  glitterati  having  their evening  coffee .
For a quick  snack , try  the smiley or the Bambay toast  for snacks .
Adinarayan Bhojanalaya : this Belgaum restaurant  is  renowned  far_and_wide  for it’s seafood ,  so much so  that patrons  come  here  from as  far  as Goa , parts  of the south   Maharashtra  and the Konkan Coast .
Shirish and Manoj Samant, the brothers  who own  the restaurant  called  as Adinarayan Bhojanalaya, contributes  to the cooking  themselves, especially  when the large   eatery  
fills_up .
Regulars  prefer  the wholesome  thalis; other  favourites  at Adinarayan Bhojanalaya are  the stuffed  clams  and the fried  or masala prawns .
At Adinarayan Bhojanalaya it is  preferable  to ask  the waiter ’s recommendation  instead of diving  into the menu .
I remember  the Sunday  breakfasts  I had  as a child  at MTR, Bangalore .
We would wake_up  as  early  as 6  am  and make_it  to MTR for rava Idli, badam milk  and the special  fruit_salad .
I also  love  the ragi  roti at Janpadaloka Kamath in Ramnagaram.
An oasis  of tranquility  in the heart  of the Bangalore , Rejuve – the spa , at the Grand Ashok, is  a beautiful  synthesis  of Indian , European  and Oriental  influence .
This is  the dream  destination  for anyone who wants  to escape  the cacophony  of the clamorous  city  and soothe  his frayed  nerves  and tired  body .
One of the largest  of its kind  in Bangalore , Rejuve – the spa  is embellished  with beautiful  gardens .
The crystal  package  works  on the belief  that the Earths ’s energies  are absorbed  by the gem_stones  and that they have  vital  healing  powers .
