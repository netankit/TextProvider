At the Draupadi ghat  evidence  of habitation  and artifacts  dating  from 1100  till 800  BC  were recovered .
Remains  from the Kushana era  (1 st  century  AD ) have been found  around the site  of the Bharadwaj ashram : little  remains  of this ancient  epoch  in the history  of this town . 
The Muslims  annexed  Allahabad in 1194 , but the foundations  of the modern  city  were laid  by the Moghul  emperor  Akbar in 1575 . 
Named  Illahabas, the city  acquired  its grand  fort  over_looking  the Sangam in 1583 . 
It is  in this fort  that Khusrau, the son  of emperor  Jahangir fought  to gain  control  of the throne  and was first  imprisoned  and then  killed  in 1615  by his brother  Shah_Jahan .
In 1801 , the British  annexed  the city  and its fort , establishing  colonial  rule  for the next  150  years .
After the mutiny  of 1857 , the British  shifted  the headquarters  of the northwestern  provinces  to Allahabad.
Lord  Canning announced  the transfer  of power  to the crown  in 1858  in this city .
In the subsequent  years  Allahabad witnessed  some  important  events  in the freedom  struggle .
Home  to Pandit Motilal Nehru, one of the most  important  leaders  of the movement , Allahabad hosted  the first  Indian  National  Congress  in 1885 .
 Mahatma_Gandhi  call  for a mass  movement  against imperialist  rule  was launched  as the Quit  India  Movement  from Allahabad in 1920 .
 In subsequent  years  Motilal Nehru's son  Pandit Jawaharlal_Nehru  spearheaded  the struggle  to its conclusion  from Anand Bhavan, the residence  that has now  been converted  into a museum .
Believe  the hype  that Uttar_Pradesh  is  full  of irresistible  textiles  and crafts.
The sector has steadily  opened_up  to privatized  participation , which has bolstered  the services  and performance  of state  run  entities  too .
Multinational  banks  have  a few  branches  in Lucknow ; both they and the Indian  banks  offer  ATM  facilities  so any  time  money  is  yours for_the_asking .
Credit_cards  are accepted  in the larger  hotels , restaurants  and commercial  establishments  in the cities  but only  cash  will do  in the smaller  towns  of the state .
In the smaller  towns  of Uttar_Pradesh , banking  options  will be  of a strictly  limited  nature , restricted  to minor  branches  of government  banks  that do not  offer  many  facilities  and are  unlikely  to change  currency  other  than dollars  and pound_sterling .
Also  the paperwork  might run  into reams  if the bank  is yet  to computerize .
Major  international  credit_cards  are widely  accepted  in the hotels  and major  shops .
Changing  money  in India  can be  a tedious  process  so change  substantial  amounts  at_a_time .
Not  all  banks  accept   traveler’s cheques  or currency  other  than dollars  or pound_sterling  and if you find  one that services  your needs  take_advantage  of it.
Lucknow , Agra  and Benares have  exchange  bureaus  where you can exchange  money ; most  main  city  branches  of Indian  banks  will exchange  money  and cash   traveler’s cheques .
Save_up  all  exchange  receipts  (encashment certificates ); these are  required  for visa  extensions  and other  formalities , and when you want  to convert  rupees  at the end  of your trip .
Uttar_Pradesh  is  an important  centre  of industry  in the country .
All  official  transactions  and meetings  are held  in Lucknow , the administrative  capital  while Kanpur is  an important  industrial  and commercial  centre .
Agra  and Varanasi are  also  major  centers  of the huge  tourism  industry .
Varanasi has  a huge  export  industry  based  on carpets  made  in the Mirzapur Bhadhoi belt  and in silk  and brocade  fabrics .
Most  business  travelers  find  doing  business  in Uttar_Pradesh  an exercise  in frustration  as the bureaucratic  red_tape  slows  things  down  as  far  as possible , the labor   base  is  sluggish  and unprofessional  and prone  to a lot  of union  activities .
Power is  forever  in short  supply  and on_the_whole , a healthy  business  environment  is  sadly  lacking .
But for those determined  to play  the business  game  in Uttar_Pradesh , here are  a few   pointers .
With increasing  liberalization  at both  the economic  level  and at the societal  level , business  protocol  adheres  to western  standards .
You’ll most  likely  be asked  questions  about family  and home  not  because anybody wants  to pry  but because many  Indians  believe  that curiosity  conveys  concern .
There are  many  women  executives , often  top  level  management .
Some however , are  still  conservative , so to make_sure  you don't  misstep , be  sensitive  to how the lady  greets  you and respond  accordingly .
Allahabad is  divided  in two  distinct  halves  by the railway_station  with the orderly  grid  patterned  Civil Lines and adjoining  districts  forming  the central  and northern  parts .
The old  city  spreads  along the eastern  banks  of the river  Yamuna.
Lying  7  kms  from the centre  is  the holiest  spot  in Allahabad, the Sangam (confluence ).
Here  the muddy  brown   Ganga  meets  the blue  Yamuna and the mystical  Saraswati, with a broad  
flood_plain  forming  a sandy  patch  in between .
Devotees  come  for ritual  bathing  in the holy  waters  at the Sangam and priests  or pandas perform  special  rites  of worship  to help  them in their quest  for salvation .
The road  to the Sangam is lined  with stalls  selling  various  religious  paraphernalia , including  flowers , vermilion  powder , coconuts  and other   offerings .
Pilgrims  also  come  to these shores  to perform  the last_rites  of their relatives .
Boats  can be hired  at the main  Ghat  
(river  landing  used  for bathing ) east  of the fort  and the official  rate  is  Rs.12  per head  or Rs.100  to Rs.120  for a boat .
The rate  invariably  goes_up  during the peak_season , especially  during the fairs  at the Sangam.
To the south  of the Sangam along the Yamuna lies  the Saraswati ghat  and close  by on the banks  of the Yamuna is  the new  Mankameshwar temple  , dedicated  to  Lord  Shiva .
The fort  is occupied  by the Indian  army  and therefore  much of it lies  out_of_bounds  to the public .
There are  three  gateways  into the fort , which is surrounded  by a 7  meter  wall .
You get  the full  impact  of this impressive  structure  from boats  on the river .
The areas  open  to the public  are  an underground  temple  believed  to have been visited  by Rama , the hero  of the Ramayana  and an incarnation  of  Lord  Vishnu .
The venerable  old  banyan_tree , supposedly  indestructible , sits  in a protected  space  within the temple .
Mentioned  by the 7 th  century  Chinese  traveler  Hiuen Tsang, this tree  is considered  sacred  and devotees  would jump  from it to gain  Moksha  (salvation ).
The Well  of Saraswati, believed  to be  the source  of the elusive  river  Saraswati, lies  inside the fort .
Close  to the fort  main  entrance  is  the polished  sandstone  Ashoka Pillar , 10 .6  meters  high  and dating  from 242  BC . 
The pillar  was brought  from the Buddhist  site  of Kausambi by emperor  Akbar and has  the edicts  of emperor  Ashoka inscribed  on it.
It also  carries  an inscription  in Persian  declaring  Jahangirs accession  to the  Moghul  throne .
To visit  the fort , you will need  to get  permission  from the Commandant  at the Ordnance  Depot  inside .
Painted  a bright  vermilion  red , the color  associated  with Hanuman , the temple  houses  a reclining  image  of the god .
During the monsoons  when the  Ganga  floods  its banks , the temple  gets  submerged .
A towering  130  feet  structure  called  the Shankar Viman Mandapam houses  images  of important  Hindu  saints  and divinities .
The site  of the ancient  Bhardwaj ashram , said  to have been visited  by  Lord  Rama  on his way  to the forest  now  lies  in the centre  of the city .
The ashram  once  housed  nearly  10 ,000  students  who studied  under the tutelage  of sage  Bhardwaj.
A memorial  in the park  commemorates  the proclamation  of the assumption  of rule  by the British_crown , announced  by Lord  Canning in 1858 . 
To the south  of Allahabad 's main  railway_station  lie  the Moghul gardens  known_as  Khusrau Bagh.
Dedicated  to Khusrau, the rebel  son  of emperor  Jahangir, the garden  holds  his mausoleum .
The simple  sandstone  tomb  completed  in 1622  lies  next to that of Khusraus mother  double  storeyed  burial_chamber .
Beyond is  another  tomb  believed  to contain  the remains  of Khusrau's sister .
The colonial  area  laid_out  in grid  pattern  during the mid 19 th  century  holds  remnants  of the Raj  era .
They include  the Uttar_Pradesh   High Court , the All Saints' Cathedral  and Allahabad University .
The 19 th  century  All Saints' Cathedral  popularly  known_as  Patthar Girjaghar (stone  church ) is  a towering  Gothic  structure  that still  holds  prayers  and Sunday  Mass .
Designed  by Sir  William Emerson, the architect  of the Victoria Memorial  in Calcutta , the outstanding  feature  of this church  is  its vivid  stained_glass  windows .
The white  marble  exteriors  are faced  in red  stone  and the altar  displays  fine  marble  inlay  work .
A memorial  tower  stands  within the park .
The library  has  a collection  of some  75 ,000  books  besides  historical  manuscripts  and journals .
The grounds  of the museum  have  a display  of ancient  sculptures , while the interior  houses  a collection  of ancient  terra_cottas  and stone  sculptures .
A remarkable  image  amongst the exhibits  is  a 12 th  century  Shiva  Parvati  from Khajuraho.
The museum  also  exhibits  ancient  coins , traditional  Rajasthani miniature  paintings  and works  of some  modern  artists  including  Jamini Roy and Nicholas Roerich.
The other  sections  of the museum  include  a portion  devoted  to natural_history  where stuffed  birds  and animals  are  in residence  and a gallery  on the independence  movement  with a good  collection  of photographs  and historical  documents .
North  of the Museum  is  the 19 th  century  Allahabad University  with its  IndoSaracenic  buildings .
Among the most  prominent  colonial  buildings  within the campus  is  the Muir College , now  housing  the Science  Faculty , built  in 1874  by Sir  William Emerson.
A quadrangle  within  has  tall  ornate  arches  and a 61  meter  tower  crested  with domes .
The tower  was built  in ochre  stone  brought  from Mirzapur, while the floors  are made  of marble  and mosaic .
The domes  are covered  with blue  and white  glazed  tiles  from the town  of Multan, now  in Pakistan .
The Mayo Memorial  Hall , built  in 1879 , had  a 180  feet  tower .
Decorated  by Professor  Gamble of the South Kensington Museum  in London , the hall  commemorated  Lord  Mayo and was built  to host  public  meetings , receptions  and balls .
About  a kilometer  from the Museum  is  the sprawling  Anand Bhawan , an elaborate  Victorian  building  set  amid well  laid_out  lawns .
Home  of Pandit Motilal Nehru and his son  Pandit Jawaharlal_Nehru , this house  has now  been turned  into a museum 
Memorabilia  of the Nehru family  are displayed  here .
 :89 : The old  section  of the Anand Bhawan called Swaraj Bhawan was donated  to the nation  in 1930  by Pandit Motilal Nehru.
Swaraj Bhawan was used  as the headquarters  of the Congress Party .
Indira_Gandhi , the daughter  of Jawaharlal_Nehru  and later  the prime_minister  of India , was  born  here .
Within the grounds  of Anand Bhawan is  the Jawahar Planetarium . 
Running  four  shows  in Hindi  in a day , the planetarium  is  of special  interest  for stargazers .
 :94 : The alpine  meadows  or bugyal of Chipla Kot lay  30  kms  beyond Munsiyari.
The small  town  is  also  a base for treks  to Milam, Ralam and Namik glaciers  and expeditions  to the Panchuli peaks .
You can also  equip  yourself with mountaineering  or trekking  gear  from the specialty_stores  in town .
Climate : Almora is  renowned  for its salubrious  atmosphere  that helped  revive  ailing  visitors .
Summers  are  pleasant  with bright  sunlight  and low  night  temperatures .
Almora gets  extremely  cold  in winters , October March , with temperatures  falling  well  below 1  °C , but June  to August  is  wet , when the monsoons  arrive  in full  fury .
Almora: Spread  over a horseshoe  ridge  at a height  of 1 ,646  meters  is  Almora, once  the centre  of Kumaoni culture  and the capital  of the Chand dynasty .
To the north  of the ridge  is  a breathtaking  view  of the trident  shaped  Trishul peaks .
On the edges  of Almora the Koshi and Suyal rivers  cut_through  the mountains , while the hill_sides  are lined  with fir  and pine  forests .
Away  from the main  tourist  humdrum  of Nainital or Ranikhet, Almora has retained  much of its traditional  values  and old  world  charm .
 One of the few   hill stations  that predated  the British , the town  still  has  cobbled  streets  and fascinating  stone  houses  with exquisite  carved  wooden  facades .
