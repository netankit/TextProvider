 :10 : Andhra_Pradesh  is  above_all  a cheerful  mix  of many  things  nice .
It has  one of the most  important  Hindu  temples  in the world  and yet  Urdu  is as  widely  spoken  and appreciated  as the more  indigenous  Telugu .
Hyderabadi cuisine  is  all  Nizami, delicately  flavored  and predominantly   nonvegetarian , while the rest  of Andhra_Pradesh  relishes  a variety  of  vegetarian  dishes .
The spice  also  includes  liberal  doses  of Buddhist  heritage   peppered  across the state , like the ruined  stupa  of Amaravathi.
This large  state  is becoming  increasingly  important  to India  in the techsavvy  age  of 
 cyberoptics  and virtual_reality .
Driven  by a dynamic  government , Andhra_Pradesh  has taken  strides  towards development  and is  today  much  better_off  than it was  10  years  ago .
Not  many  tourists  take  the time  to discover  the treasures  of Andhra_Pradesh , daunted  by its size  and the fact  that the major  attractions  are  spread  across squares  of miles  of tough  terrain . 
But, if you chose  carefully , Andhra_Pradesh  is  as  rewarding  a destination  as its more  popular  neighbours , Tamil_Nadu , Kerala and Karnataka .

Myriad  tribes  who still  preserve  their own  identities , cultures , traditions  and lifestyles  inhabit  this state , which has stayed  in glorious  isolation  for so  long .

The simplicity  of the tribal  people  and the untamed  profusion  of nature  make  you feel  like you are  in a time  warp .
The  gateway  to the northeast , Assam  is  wedged  into a green  valley  with the Himalayan  foothills  in the north  and the state  of Meghalaya in the south .
With the mighty  Brahmaputra_River  raging  through it, Assam  is  one of the most  fertile  states  in India  spread  over 800  kms  of lush  forests  and paddy_fields .
Best  known  for its terraced  tea  gardens  that produce  some of the world  finest  tea  and the one horned  rhino  that roams  free  in the Kaziranga Park , Assam  also  boasts  of numerous  golf_courses  dotting  the many  tea  estates .
Until recently , Assam  was  out_of_bounds  for the traveler .
Militants  had rebelled  against the rule_of_law  and believed  they were fighting  to protect  the interests  of the original  inhabitants  of the state .
Much  chaos  and confusion  ensued  until a peace  accord  was signed  with the government .

Each  cave  has  its own  story  to tell .

Pride_of_place  here  goes  to the gigantic  Kailasa Temple , the world  largest  monolithic  sculpture , which required  hours  of diligent  chiseling , sculpting  and carving  and scooping_out  of an estimated  200 ,000  tons  of basalt  rock , with absolutely  no  margin  for error !
