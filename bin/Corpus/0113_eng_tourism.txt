Daxu town  is  really  a sight  offthebeaten_track . 
Opposite  the town  on the other  side  of the river , a millstone like  rock  with the running  waters  creates  the scene  of grinding  grain .
Crown Cave  (Guanyan):  A crown like  crag  earns  the hill  its name .
What makes  the hill  a worthy  stop  for both  river  cruise  tourists  and those arriving  from Guilin City  by bus  tour  is  its twelve  kilometer  long  water eroded  cave .
It is  a wonderland  of various  stalactite , stone  pillars  and rock  formations  in the Crown cave .
Since it opened  to tourists  in 1995 , illuminating  lights , sound  control  tour  guide  system  and escalators  are equipped  in the scenic  area  and sightseeing  cars  and boats  enable  visitors  to tour  inside the cave .

HalfSide Ferry (Ban Bian Du): Not  very  far  from the Crown Cave  on the western  bank , a huge  rock  descends  into the river  and cuts off a footpath  by the water  edge .
Villagers  have to take  a ferry  to reach  the other  side  and continue  the way, so this spot  gets  its name  HalfSide Ferry (for usually  ferry  means  to transport  people  by boat  across a 
body_of_water  and reach  the opposite  bank )
Down_stream  from Yangdi to Xingping, the river  passes  an endless  procession of distinct  peaks  and bamboo  groves  and the stunning  landscape .

 :44 : Legendary  stories  are given  to hill  rocks  and peaks  and it is  a delightful  experience  to appreciate  the stunning  landscape  while listening  to tour_guide  interpretation  of the stories  behind it.
Cormorants  are  good  sized  birds  that enjoy  diving  under water  in search  of fish .
Fishermen  use  the cormorants  to catch  the fish  and return  them to the boat .
The picture  shows  a cormorant  fisher  girl  but I think  the girl  is  just  a model  for shots .
The fisherman  drives  the birds  into the water  where they dive  below the surface  in search  of fish .
When the birds  catch  a fish  they return  to the boat  and the fisherman  removes  the fish  from their throat  and places  it in the basket .
The secret  is  that the fisherman  places  a cord  around the bird  neck  to keep  the bird  from swallowing  the fish .
You will see  buffalos  grazing  along the river_bank  or patrolling  on the fields , they seem  to be  indispensable  friends  of peasants , especially  for kids .
Boating  downstream  southward  from the Mural Hill  about  500  meters , peaks  become  steep  and the river  becomes  wide  and quiet .
A huge  yellow  flagstone  lying  under the limpid  waters  can easily  be seen  and it is  like a cloth  piece  and people  called  it Yellow  Cloth  Shoal .
There are  seven  green  peaks  standing  nearby .
A legend  goes  that the seven  peaks  are  fairy  girls  from the heaven  who took  baths  in the river .
 :56 : Enthralled  by the charming  scene , they stayed  here  and became  the peaks .
 :57 : With verdant  bamboos , the green  peaks  under the blue_sky  reflected  on the quiet  waters  create  a spectacular  scene .
 :58 : Sometimes , people  doubt  they see  boats  floating  on hill_tops .
Many  Chinese  paintings  and poems  present  this charming  scene  and tourists  run_out  of their films  for it.
The river  takes  a big  turn  at Xingping and is  endowed  with beautiful  and poetic  scenery .
It has been reproduced  in many  Chinese  landscape_paintings , even  the newly issued  20  RMB note  has  the scenery  on its back .
A photographer  once  said : 'Shots  from any  perspective  for this place  turn_out  to be  impressive  and stunning '.
A 'village ' on the river_bank  is  worth  a visit ; the Chinese  call  it a 'village ' because of the fact  that nowadays  it is inhabited  by villagers .
Actually , it is  an ageold  castle  complex  survived  from over 500  years  ago , although some  courtyard  buildings  have weathered  through ages . 
The simple  but elegant  flying eaves , roofs  with colorful  paintings , lattice  windows  and unique  timber  structures  present  the folk  residence  from the Ming  and Qing  Dynasties .
The villagers  have  the same  surname  of Zhao, so it is rumored  that they are  descendents  of the imperial  family  in the Song_Dynasty .
Both  Dr.  Sun_Yatsen , the pioneer  of China  democratic  revolution  and US_president  Clinton  paid  a visit  to the village  on their visits  to Li River .
Li River  cruise  makes  the small  town  known  to foreigners . 
Yangshuo is  located  some  90  kilometers  south  of Guilin City : this town  is  the downstream  end  of the cruise  but not  the last .
The enchanting   fairyland  of Yangshuo is  renowned  as the best  in Guilin.
The town  is  very  small  that everyone will know  you after one  month  and the West Street  in the town  lined  with western  cafes , restaurants  and hotels  is  the best  choice  for people  who want  to explore  Chinese  life .
Yangshuo is  a great  place  for hikes  and cycling  excursions .
There's no  doubt  that taking  a closeup  exploration  to the country  villages , you will have  a taste  of the rural  life .
One  thing  surprised  us is  the one hour  bamboo  raft  trip  along Yulonghe River . 
We didn't expect  the scenery  to be  such  a paradise .
The Old  Town  of Lijiang, a well preserved  old  city  of ethnic_minorities  with brilliant  culture , is  a central  town  of the Lijiang Autonomous  County  of the Naxi Ethnic_Minority  in Yunnan_Province .
The Old  Town  of Lijiang, located  on the plateau  which is  2 ,400  meters  (7 ,874  feet ) above the sea_level  and embraced by the tree covered  Lion Mountain  in the west , Elephant and Golden Row Mountains  in the north , vast  fertile  fields  in the southeast  and crystal_clear  water  
running  through , the old  town  looks  like a big  jade  ink  slab , therefore  got  the alias  the Town  of Big  Ink  Slab  (Dayanzhen).
The Old  Town  which occupies  an area  of three point eight  square kilometers  (912  acres ) was firstly  built  in the late  Song_Dynasty  and the early  Yuan_Dynasty  and has  a history  of more_than  800  years .
Since Kubla_Khan  who was  the first  emperor  of the Yuan_Dynasty  set  his reign  here , Lijiang was  on a fast  developmental  way  and became  the political , cultural , and educational  center  in this area , playing  a very  important  role  in the trading  activities  among Yunnan , China  hinterland , Tibet , India  and many  other  Asian  countries .
Till now , when walking  on the streets  of the Old  Town , one can feel  the prosperity  and flourish  of the town  from the shops  with fancy  and superb  collections  of handicrafts .
The Lijiang Old  Town  is built  along the line  of mountains  and the flow  of rivers , providing  a very  precious  sample  of the research  on the oldtime  architecture .
The unique  geographical  location , historical  background  and multiracial  inhabitants  make  Old   town  the most  special  one.
The Old  Town  is  the only  old  city  built  without a city  wall  and there is  an interesting  story  telling  the reason . 
Lijiang had been  under the reign  of the hereditary  Mu family  for more_than  500  years .
If the Chinese  character  'Mu' (represents  the governor  of Lijiang) is put  into a frame  (represents  the city  wall ), you have  the character  'Kun' which means  'siege ' or 'predicament '. 
This would mean  that the governing  Mu family  and their descendants  would always  be trapped  like a rat  in a hole 
As a result  of the combination  of the multinational  culture  and the progress  of Naxi ethnic_minority , the buildings  in the town  incorporate  the best  parts  of the architectural  traits  of Han , Bai, and Tibet  into a unique  Naxi style .
The layout  of the town  is  freestyle and flexible , the houses  are  close  and diverse , and the lanes  are  narrow  and meandering . 
Naxi people  pay  much  attention  to the decoration , the commodious  and applied  houses  are  mostly  timber  and tile  structure  compound  with a garden , each has  engraved  vivid  figures  of people  and animals  on doors  and windows , beautiful  flowers  and trees  in the garden .
Living  in such a beautiful  and comfortable  environment  is  a real  pleasant  thing  in Old  Town  of Lijiang.
The old  Town  of Lijiang as a city  depends  on water  for existence  and water  is  just  like its blood .
Black Dragon Pool  (Heilongtan) is  the main  water  source  of the town  and subdivides  into many  streams  which can reach  every  family  and every  street  in the town .
Due_to  the reticular  aqueducts , willow_trees  grow  everywhere  and there are  almost  350  varied  and inimitable  bridges  in the little  town , some of which were built  in the Ming  and Qing  Dynasties .
The usage  of the water  created  by the local  people  is  very  scientific ; they build  three  mouths  to every  well  from the upriver  to the downriver .
The water  in the first  mouth  is  for edibility , the second  one is  for cleaning  of the vegetables  and fruits , and the last  one is used  to wash  the clothes .
The water  not_only  meets  the need  of the dweller , but also  gives  the town  a gentle  beauty  .
The town  is reputed  as the 'Oriental  Venice ' and 'Suzhou in Highland ', but it is  much , much  more  than this.
Once  you have visited  Old  Town  Lijiang, it will capture  your heart  for the rest  of your life .
The center  of the Old  Town  is  the Square Street  (Sifangjie). 
Four  main_streets  radiate  from Square Street  and extend  to the four  different  directions . 
Countless  lanes  extending  in all  directions  form  a network  and connect  every  corner  of the town .
Streets  in the Old  Town  are paved  by the local  bluestones  which are  neither muddy  in the 
rainy_season  nor dusty  in the dry_season .
The massive  and finegrained  stones  add  a sense  of antiquity  and mystery  to the Old  Town .
The sluice  at the center  of the town  is opened  late  in the night  and the resulting  current  of water  flushes  and washes  all  the streets  to keep  the town  clean .
